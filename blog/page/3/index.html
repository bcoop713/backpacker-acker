				<p>I&#8217;ve been on the road for 5 months now and am finally really &#8216;traveling.&#8217;  It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve done any (almost 8 months since I was in Southern Mexico and a full year from my Cuba/Dominican Republic trip.)  I&#8217;m on my 5th day in Thailand and already I feel as though I have been here for weeks, if not months.  The days go by excruitatingly slow and I couldn&#8217;t be any happier.  I feel as though the past 5 months in Korea have been justified and this is my reward.</p>
<p>The flight from Busan to Bangkok was only 5 hours but it feels like it should have been 16.  Thailand feels a world away from Korea.  The food is distinctly different (read: better)  and the people have a genuine friendliness to them.  They seem very content with their lives and very happy to be alive.  I have only been in the country for 5 days so I will report back after my full month here.  I have reached the point of traveling where I wake up every morning and have to sit up and think, ok what day is it?  I then debate with myself what day it is and around what date it is&#8230;(I&#8217;m usually within 3-4 days correct) That&#8217;s totally perfect and I know it means I&#8217;ve really let my mind go. (or is it the beers?)  Maybe it&#8217;s the countless Budhist temples I wander into every day, or the passing Monks who love to have a small chat, but my mind is quite at peace right now and there&#8217;s no better feeling in the world than that.  Here are a few temples, the pictures won&#8217;t load properly here in Thailand so until now you&#8217;ll have to click a few links to see them&#8230;Also since I was traveling alone there aren&#8217;t any shots of me, those will come next week, sorry folks&#8230;<br />

<p>The flight to Bangkok was delayed about an hour so I had a good chance to admire the Busan airport, all 7 gates in their full glory.  There was a man/woman dressed in a large Christmas Tree walking around for some reason and that kept me mildy entertained while I waited for the plane to be ready.  In Busan, for the larger planes, you get on a bus that drives you to the plane and you board that way.  The plane was huge but only filled maybe 25% to capacity.  I had my own row and had ample time to practice my meditation when the apparent China pollution rattled our plane like a jackhammer.  Nonethelss, I arrived safely, thanked my pilot, and headed into the crazy city of Bangkok.  I grabbed a taxi, who was very friendly and laughed at all the things I said, even if I&#8217;m not sure he knew what they meant.  He thought I was hilarious and immediately I thought to myself, I love this country already.</p>
<p>After getting lost for a little while, I finally found my step-dad&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s house in Bangkok.  He has a beautiful beautiful 3 story house and they gave me my own guestroom for the night.  In the morning, everyone had left to work and their maid, who was very kind, called a taxi for me as I needed to get to Chiang Mai for my supposed &#8216;hill trek.&#8217;  Well I took a taxi to the train station but every train was sold out except for the 10pm one which would put me into Chiang Mai at noon, way too late for my trek.  It might have been a blessing.  After doing some more research, I&#8217;ve read quite terrible things about the exploitation of the hill tribes by the commerical tourism and decided against it.  On my much larger trip next fall, I plan on exploring most of Laos and doing a hill trek there to visit a tribe where the government supposedly only grants very few permits and allows very few tourists.  </p>
<p>The overnight train was like most every other overnight train I&#8217;ve taken except for the fact that at first it doesn&#8217;t look like there are any beds on this train.  Sitting there across from my &#8216;bunk-mate&#8217; I looked around thinking to myself, &#8220;damnit, I swear I asked for a sleeper car.&#8221;  Then out of nowhere, big Thai men come and point at you and say &#8220;sleep now&#8221; and boom, a giant circus of a show goes on complete with beds folding down out of the ceiling, and benches being transformed into beds.  5 minutes later, I&#8217;m in my bed falling asleep to the trains rocking motion like a little baby.</p>
<p>The train pulled into Chiang Mai at around 11am and as we got off the train, I was more than happy to see a familiar sight, Backpackers!  Living in Busan, I haven&#8217;t met ANY travelers, and if on the off-chance I did meet a few, I think the conversation would go something like this:</p>
<p>Me:  Wow you guys are the first backpackers I&#8217;ve ever seen in Busan!<br />
Traveler 1:  WHAT? What is Busan?  Our travel guide told us he booked us to Tokyo!<br />
Me:  Yeah, that sucks, you&#8217;re in South Korea buddy.<br />
Traveler:  Noooooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_28811" class="attachmentlink">img_28811</a></p>
<p>Anyway, the last five days in Chiang Mai have been very relaxing.  This is a big city but it doesn&#8217;t feel that big.  I walk around the old city each day getting lost, taking pictures, finding my hostel, only to get lost 20 minutes later.  The people are so friendly and accomodating.  The food is great here as well.  Two dollars will get you a large plate of anything.  I have eaten like a king.  The people up there are genuinely friendly, even in such a large city and it is a pleasant change from Bangkok.</p>
<p>All the temples require you to remove your shoes before entering but I found it funny that when I walked into my first temple, there was one of the ugliest stray dogs in the temple &#8220;meditating.&#8221;  I guess flea-infested dogs can come in and find inner peace, but don&#8217;t you dare wear your shoes in.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_29001" class="attachmentlink">img_29001</a></p>
<p>I take tuk tuks everywhere, which are essentially motorcycles with a bench on the back and two wheels in the back.  They are quite cheap and some of the drivers are insane!  It&#8217;s fun thinking what he will do next and then he does the complete opposite, some have been too high that I&#8217;ve waved them along and flagged others.  Last thing I want is a high tuk tuk driver, that would equal disaster.  The first tuktuk I had in Chiang Mai, he had his little puppy in the front in a box along for the ride, so I thought, if he at least doesn&#8217;t care about my safety, surely he&#8217;ll drive more carefully because of the little guy&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_28831" class="attachmentlink">img_28831</a></p>
<p>The highlight of the week was undoubtely last night when at 4:45 in the morning, a GIANT explosion occured right outside my window.  Sparks flew everywhere and I&#8217;m ashamed to say I hit the deck of my guestroom immediately.  Now people, we all know BPA is tough, but this was not a small firecracker.  This was a genuine explosion that made the room and windows shake violently.  I hit the deck and did my best Army crawl towards the window to see if I could see a deranged Thai lobbing gernades at my window.  I don&#8217;t know if it was the 7% alcohol beer I drank before I went to bed, but for about 10 seconds I genuinely believed I might die in that Thai guesthouse and was in complete &#8216;survival&#8217; mode.  Funny now, not funny then.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, I&#8217;m staying in the Khao San area, some of you who have been here know this is where all the backpackers stay and it&#8217;s quite cheap.  The first night I stayed at a place that was realllly cheap but I paid dearly.  The cell&#8212;I mean room was located just on top of the kitchen and I smelled fried food the entire night, I think the cockroaches in the room were actually fatter than the ones in the other rooms as they were always smelling food and especially hungry.  I bounced out of there in a hurry in the morning and found a different place, for 12 bucks, it even has a pool.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, I&#8217;ve been visiting more temples, getting lost, laying at the pool and eating 70 cent plates of Thai food.  Amazing stuff.  Met a real nice man the other day who helped me find the skytrain after I got lost down some back streets.  It turns out he was from Chiang Mai, born and raised, and could speak English decently well.  We talked for 15 minutes and I was really ready for him to offer me something (which is a common theme here) in the way of a tour, drugs, massages, whatever, but at the end of the conversation he simply said &#8220;It was nice to meet you my friend&#8221; and walked away with a smile and a handshake.  I felt bad for thinking he wanted something out of the chat but in Bangkok, it happens everywhere you go and gets quite annoying.  Bottom line: Chiang Maiians sp.?  are some of the most friendly people I&#8217;ve encountered, up there with Australians, Kiwis, Cubans, and everyone from Latin America.</p>
<p>Today, I laid out at the pool and even went for a dip.  The crowd up there was very global and very friendly.  I made small talk with a German woman there with her family and her little son who was 4 and swimming around the pool with floaties naked.  A German nirvana CD cover if you will.   At one point I looked over at the kid, gave him a Hello and a smile to which he looked back with a face of shall I say &#8220;contentment.&#8221;  Now I was once a kid, and I have swam and subsequently been in the ocean and had to go the bathroom and I knew that face!  Out of the pool I went in a hurry and down to my room to shower.  A wise choice I think, that little devil. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m heading to the airport in a bit to get Jen and we&#8217;ll stay here for another few days then get the Tuesday morning train to the border of Thailand and Cambodia.  From there we will walk across the border, clear immigration and get a 3 hour share-taxi ride to Siem Reap.  We&#8217;ll stay there for 4-5 days and visit the temples and do all things Cambodian.  Back to Bangkok after that and a bus to Phuket where 15 days of island hopping will start&#8230;</p>
<p>Kwhop-Kuhn-Krap  (thank you in Thai)</p>

				<p>In Bangkok now, all overnight trains that would put me in on time to CHiang Mai for the hill trek were sold out. All together now&#8230;D&#8217;oh!</p>
<p>I have done research about other companies and am becoming more and more disillusioned with how the treks work and the exploitation of the tribes. Hill Trek might be on hold until my return to SE asia in the fall where I will visit Vietnam and Laos and more parts of Cambodia. I&#8217;ve heard great things about Hill Treks in Laos.</p>
<p>Will keep you all posted.</p>

				<p>My backpack is loaded once again and I&#8217;m leaving for the airport in a few hours.  Will spend the night at a distant family member&#8217;s house in Bangkok.  Will grab the overnight train from Bangkok Monday night and arrive ready for the three day trek through the jungle on Tuesday morning in Chiang Mai.</p>
<p>Here is a map of Thailand so you can see where exactly I&#8217;ll be.  Chiang Mai first, then east to Cambodia for a week, then south to Phuket where we will catch boats and island hop for a few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/thailand.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1231641099]" title="thailand.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/thailand.thumbnail.jpg" alt="thailand.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="400" width="235" /></a></p>
<p>On a side note, my last blog post commented on National Pride and how many Asians have this deep, deep national pride.  Well, I think this story only hammers my point home:</p>
<p>This story comes from China, here are some bits of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the third time, he&#8217;s tasted the flesh of an unwitting intruder in his pen at the Beijing Zoo.<br />
His most recent victim was 28-year-old Zhang Jiao, who told CNN he fell into the panda pen Wednesday while trying to catch a small toy thrown by his young son.   (this is where it gets good)</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The panda is a national treasure, and I love and respect [him], so I didn&#8217;t fight back,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;The panda didn&#8217;t let go until it chewed up my leg and its mouth was dripping with my blood.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>So there you have it.  Imagine the self-restraint and what he was thinking&#8230;&#8221;Golly, there&#8217;s a giant 280 pound panda chewing on my thigh bone, I should totally kick it off of me&#8212;no wait&#8212;it&#8217;s a national treasure, I&#8217;m gonna let this one play itself out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found that story amusing.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/01/09/panda.attack/index.html" title="National Pride Panda!" target="_blank">Here</a> is the full article courtesy of CNN.</p>
<p>I will post an entry Thursday night from an internet cafe in Chiang Mai after my trek.  That is, if all goes according to plan, which it usually never does on a trip&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your comments, talk to you all from Chiang Mai.</p>
<p>peace</p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">I&#8217;m three long days from the 90 degree weather of Thailand and Cambodia for one month.  So I&#8217;ll wrap up the holidays and let you all in on a little story that kind of explains &#8220;what is Korea.&#8221;  Before I get to the story, we did go on a hike last week (again) and it proved to be a beautiful one.  The weather is a constant 45-55 degrees here through out the winter so there is ample time to hike even through the dead of the winter.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">Pretty much along every one of the hundreds of hikes on the dozens of mountains in my city, they have outdoor work out gyms where just in case, hiking doesn&#8217;t do it for you, you can pump some iron as well.  I&#8217;ve made a few comments about &#8216;training for Rio 2016, that&#8217;s the summer olympics) and anyone who knows me, knows I, even though I hail from Chicago by way of Detroit, do not want the olympics in Chicago in 2016.  My quick two cents on this race&#8230;</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2767.jpg" title="img_2767.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2767.jpg" alt="img_2767.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">Chicago is in no way prepared to handle that amount of people in its city.  The transportation system is simply a mess to put it nicely, the trains resemble a pre-WW2 era system and the buses have very few clean energy vehicles.  Cyclists don&#8217;t have a shot in that city which is a shame because if they were given a decent shot, the city would thrive.  It&#8217;s one of the fattest cities in the world (if the olympics are in the USA, at least have it in a place where pasty white rich people aren&#8217;t strolling from Saks to the Apple Store on Michigan avenue and calling it &#8216;exercise&#8217;)</p>
<p>The main reason is this&#8212;I can&#8217;t help but feel that we have entirely ****ed over the world these past 8 years and in no way should we be rewarded for such activity.  The U.S.A. had the olympics in Atlanta and Salt Lake in the past 14 years.  There&#8217;s other places that deserve a shot.  That is why I am supporting Rio for the olympics among other reasons, my love with Central and South America ranks very highly in that decision.  Don&#8217;t worry Chicago, you&#8217;ll get your olympics, after all, Chicago politics is alive and well, but just remember what I am saying now (I&#8217;m talking to you French tourist) when you are sitting on the Blue Line and the conductor  announces the train has broken down&#8230;C.T.A.= Can&#8217;t Transport Anybody&#8230;</p>
<p>moving on&#8230;</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2774.jpg" title="img_2774.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2774.jpg" alt="img_2774.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"><br />
The hike was about 3 hours round trip.  We ended up coming out on the totally wrong side of the mountain and had to take a taxi back to the apartment.  Here are some random shots from the hike&#8230;</span></p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2782.jpg" title="img_2782.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2782.jpg" alt="img_2782.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"></span></p>
<p><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2784.jpg" title="img_2784.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2784.jpg" alt="img_2784.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">I&#8217;ve had to do winter camps the past two weeks at school.  That means I come in from 9am-Noon and just play games and do art projects with the kids.  Here&#8217;s us after we made snowmen.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">Let&#8217;s see&#8230;holidays&#8230;we did a Christmas potluck and for New Years our aim was to stay up all night and watch the sunrise on Haeundae Beach.  I guess it&#8217;s a typical Korean custom to watch the New Year&#8217;s first sunrise, and there&#8217;s no better spot than Haeundae beach.  Anyway, we ended up at some club and spent the New Years Eve there dancing and drinking.  We only made it until 5am and ended up sleeping most of the day January 1st.</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2824.jpg" title="img_2824.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2824.jpg" alt="img_2824.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">The highlight of my week came in two different occasions, both scary, but eventually OK moments.  The first was after I had bought some various groceries I was leaving the market along side a girl, maybe 15 years old.  I stopped at the cross-walk but there was a large truck parked right on the crosswalk (personal injury lawyers are now composing the e-mail) so I could not see if any cars were coming.  I slowly walked edged my way out to see if it was clear as the girl next to me darted out and BAM! smacked by a car.  The taxi struck her and she flew up onto the roof and laid on the pavement for maybe 4 seconds.  It was surreal and definitely the first time I had ever seen anyone struck by a car.  The girl popped up and limped back in the market as the taxi driver chased her into the store to see if she was OK.  (annnnnd personal injury lawyers have just swamped my e-mail inbox to get the girl&#8217;s name, damnit!)</p>
<p>The second story is a bit more interesting and complex.  I was holding my winter camp sessions where I do arts and crafts activities in English with 40 kids 5 days a week for three hours a day.  We were making french toast (which the kids loved) when one of my students came in to tell me they &#8220;think bad smell&#8221; in the hallway.  Teaching elementary school kids, I&#8217;ve learned to deal with the horrible smells and noises that come out of their bodies so I passed it off as nonsense.</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2842.jpg" title="img_2842.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2842.jpg" alt="img_2842.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"><br />
Few minutes later two more students told me to go look.  I headed up the stairs to the floor above us and definitely detected a faint smell of smoke.  Well I opened the main doors to the hallway and this is what I saw&#8230;</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"> </span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2849.jpg" title="img_2849.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2849.jpg" alt="img_2849.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"><br />
So immediately I had flashbacks to senior year of college at my house, but then realized I wasn&#8217;t in college anymore and I&#8217;d better do something quickly.  This is where the hilarity ensues.  I went back downstairs with the children to get my other Korean teacher in the classroom next to me.  She then insisted on coming back upstairs to the smokey volcano about to go off upstairs with her 7 month pregnant unborn baby.  I suggested this was a bad idea, but off we went.  When we got up there, she proceeded to open every window until she started coughing and I took her by the arm and firmly said &#8220;let&#8217;s call fire department.&#8221;  INSTEAD of calling the fire department, we go downstairs to notify a few male teachers.  Well this is when I joined the Kaewon Elementary School Voluntary Fire Brigade.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">We come downstairs and the smoke has spread, this is now our view&#8230;</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2851.jpg" title="img_2851.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2851.jpg" alt="img_2851.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">then this&#8230;</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2853.jpg" title="img_2853.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2853.jpg" alt="img_2853.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">so whats the next most logical thing to do?  Forget the fire department, ya know, trained professionals who know how to put out fires and have gear that allow them to walk through smoke, we&#8217;re going to battle this thing ourselves!  With our mini-hose!  I really thought they might pull out the school&#8217;s pet hamster, attach a mini-camera on the hamster&#8217;s head, pat it on the ass, and tell it to go run reconnaissance, sending it right under the smoke into the inferno.  (ok that&#8217;s a joke, but it wouldn&#8217;t have completely surprised me, actually, it would have, they love that hamster more than they like me&#8212;I think I once heard one student call it &#8220;better teacher Jared&#8221;) but i digress&#8230;</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2855.jpg" title="img_2855.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2855.jpg" alt="img_2855.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"><br />
After numerous efforts to walk into the smoke (who knew Koreans couldn&#8217;t breathe in smoke either) after me saying fire department 7 or 8 times, they decided to make the dreadful call.  The Busan Fire Department arrived quickly although part of me was afraid the principal of my school was going to stop them at the gate and say &#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re just going to need to borrow your truck for a few minutes.&#8221;  But alas, they marched into the school in full gear, like scuba divers with giant hoses, breathing like aliens from their tanks and masks, right into that smoke.  I thought to ask them where their Dalmatian was but I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to know the answer.  (yes, they very much eat those here)</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">Twenty minutes later, the fire was put out and I went to inspect the damage&#8230;</p>
<p></span><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2862.jpg" title="img_2862.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2862.jpg" alt="img_2862.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a></p>
<p><a rel="lightbox[pics163]" href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2863.jpg" title="img_2863.jpg"><img width="360" src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2863.jpg" alt="img_2863.jpg" height="270" class="imageframe imgalignleft" /></a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">This is where the story turns funny, if you know Korea at all.  Back in my English Club class, the students are asking me about the fire and what it looked like, what was burned, etc.  I gave them answers and one student raised his hand and said he saw the fire.  I said oh that&#8217;s nice, thinking he meant from a distance.  It turns out he was in the room with the student who started the fire in the empty classroom that morning.  I immediately whisked him off to the upstairs area where there were 4 or 5 uniformed police officers and 2 detectives along with fire marshalls.  I told one teacher (a prominent male elder teacher) what I knew and he whisked us both away from all the officials.  He took my student into an office and only god knows what was said to him.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: arial" class="Apple-style-span">Upon returning to the lounge, I was met by my co-teacher and same said elder teacher among other Korean teachers.  My co-teacher, in the nicest way possible, told me that I was wrong and that it was an &#8220;electrical fire.&#8221;  I said OK, and she added, &#8220;it is very important to your professional career that you remember it was an electrical fire and never comment on this again.&#8221;  So the child who started the fire is back in school while two classrooms lay charred on the fourth floor.  Obviously, it&#8217;s better that no one find out that our precious school has a delinquent in it.  (sarcasm)</p>
<p>This story really brings me to final conclusions of the first part of my stay in Korea.  My last day of the semester is today and I feel I owe some sort of wrap-up for my first semester living and working in Korea.  I&#8217;m going to run you through my favorite things about Korea and my least favorite things.  Let me preface this with, don&#8217;t write me damn e-mails saying I&#8217;m generalizing or stereotyping Koreans.  I have many Korean friends and these are simply my observations from my 4.5 months here.  I don&#8217;t know the reasons behind many of these actions and don&#8217;t pretend to think I could ever understand any of these behaviors.  Like my friend Jason said, these are my own thoughts, not facts, just what I have felt from being thrown into a new culture for 4.5 months and I am comparing it to that of my own, there are no rights and wrongs.</p>
<p>Least Favorite Things About Korea:</p>
<p><strong>1)  Save Face at all costs! </strong> This is in reference to many stories like the fire one above.  Koreans are deeply afraid of being embarrassed and must protect their reputation no matter the costs.<br />
<strong><br />
2) Seriously, it&#8217;s an escalator! </strong> OK people, when you get off an escalator, and it&#8217;s crowded, you can&#8217;t stop right at the top and look around for three minutes.  It creates terrible problems.  Keep walking!  I know you didn&#8217;t have to move to get to that second floor but now you are at the second floor, and you have to move!</p>
<p><strong>3) Close Minded</strong>&#8211;  This may the case that Koreans are just extremely nationalistic and country-oriented, but I feel like many people here are close minded to other cultures and ideas.  It is notoriously known Korea is a very racist (against Blacks and South Asians) country.  They are very set in their ways.  Very reluctant to hear other points of views or new ways of going about something.  The fact that a city of three million people has only a handful (less than 5) of Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian places, when they are all so close, is rather disappointing.<br />
<strong><br />
4)  It&#8217;s OK to cover your mouth when sneezing and coughing, really, its OK, no, I swear it&#8217;s OK.</strong>&#8211;  For a country so afraid of germs and for people that wear masks all over the streets.   If you cough on me in the States and I feel the air hit my face from your sick mouth, brother, we have problems.  I&#8217;ve had numerous &#8216;cough-by&#8217;s now and they are terrible experiences.</p>
<p><strong>5) Fashion and Appearance-</strong>  Women wear extremelyyyyyy short skirts and shorts but would not dare to show any shoulder or neck.  Just now allowed.  I just find it funny, because when I say short skirts, I mean short skirts.  I&#8217;d think it&#8217;d be the other way around.  Men-  Golly, I&#8217;m not sure what I think.  Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;ve mistaken maybe 40 Korean men for women since I got here.  High school boys and middle school boys have all grown their hair out and are constantly grooming and combing each others hair.  When I see a group of high school boys, I really worry about the future of Korea if things ever went horribly wrong with the North.  I say this is in the most serious tone possible.  I am genuinely worried.  I deep down hope, that somewhere in Korea, is the Korea&#8217;s  equivalent of the States&#8217; &#8220;Texas good ol&#8217; boys&#8221; ready to throw down at a moments notice and get &#8220;in the shit.&#8221;  If not, gosh I don&#8217;t know.   Mirrors are everywhere here, sometimes there will be a crowd stopped and huddled in a busy subway stop, upon inching closer, you get there and notice it&#8217;s just a giant mirror that the government erected in the subway station that people are crowding around.  I could go on forever about how many mirrors there are but I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>The Best of Korea</p>
<p><strong>1) Genuinely Friendly</strong>&#8211;  I haven&#8217;t met a &#8220;mean&#8221; person in Korea.  Maybe not all are that friendly when walking down the street, but every Korean I have taken the time to try and talk to or buy something from has been extremely helpful and friendly.  Keep in mind, that five years ago, Busan hardly had any foreigners.  Now they have some, so they are learning to live with us and we are with them.  I love the sense of community around my apartment.  Saying Hello every single morning to the 80 year old Korean man downstairs is awesome.  Having the security guards wave to us and yell hello is amazing.  I miss that so much and it reminds me soooo much of Latin America.  It really makes my day.  There are a lot of people in the States who say &#8220;learn English or get out.&#8221;  Well, I&#8217;m still struggling mightily with my Korean and I haven&#8217;t got one ounce of disrespect because of it.  My school co-workers have treated me like a son, and it&#8217;s just been amazing to me how they&#8217;ve done that.<br />
<strong><br />
2) Respect for Elders-</strong>  Elderly are greatly respected here.  Oldest in the room always get to have his or her food first in the lunchroom.  No matter what.   No exceptions.  I&#8217;m only 26 but my students treat me with great respect most of the time.  I ask them to do things and they do them, no bitching and moaning like American students.  I have to say, I might have taken advantage of this a few times.  &#8220;Baeuk- Su In, go upstairs to my office and get me the sports illustrated ok?&#8221;  &#8220;yes teacher.&#8221;  I told myself I wouldn&#8217;t do that anymore.  I think.   It is nice to see that respect for elders is alive and well in some parts of the world.</p>
<p><strong>3)  Bowing and shoes</strong>&#8211;  Bowing is still so cool and unique to me, I love it.  The fact that this is something they were doing thousands of years ago and still are today is amazing.  I tried to adopt this in the States regarding the shoes, but it never caught on.  Tell me why on earth you would want to walk around your house in the shoes you just were wearing on the subway train or on the sidewalk?  Think about that.  Disgusting.  So when I do make it back to the States, you can be sure that will be a rule wherever I live.</p>
<p><strong>4) BB Guns, Batting Cages, Cheap silly things-</strong> BB Guns, I now have 2.  A sig 9 handgun and a M-16 type thing.  I can&#8217;t even explain why I have them, maybe it&#8217;s because when I was a kid, I never would have been allowed to have one.  I hardly even use em, except to shoot my neighbor&#8217;s window when I need to ask him something (these BB guns couldn&#8217;t kill an ant).  Batting cages are on every street and are extremely cheap.  Gatorade large bottles are only 1.75 US dollars.  Way cheaper here.</p>
<p><strong>5) Mountains and Ocean-</strong> The mountains are literally everywhere you look, every city you go.  The ocean is blue and has some excellent waves.</p>
<p>What I miss most&#8230;</p>
<p>1)  I miss hamburgers, steaks, burritos from La Pasadita in Chicago.<br />
2)  I miss riding my damn bicycle so much it hurts me inside.<br />
3)  I miss waking up on Sunday, drinking a beer, and watching NFL, or going to Schostak&#8217;s crib and watching the Pistons and analyzing each game.  Espn.com just doesn&#8217;t cut it sometime.<br />
4)  I miss my family and friends.  I hate walking down the street and pulling out my cell phone like I used to in Chicago and dialing a random friend or my brother or dad, and talking about the Pistons just to kill ten minutes on my walk home.  I can&#8217;t do that and it sucks sometimes.  I miss my mom and her cooking and my sister and her advice.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t complain, by the time most of you will be reading this I will be a few beers deep and on a beach somewhere in Thailand I hope.  Sunday night I will head to Thailand where I am lucky enough to have a place to crash from my step dad&#8217;s cousin Danny.  He has been living with his family in Thailand for a while and I&#8217;m real lucky to get to meet them.  I&#8217;m looking forward to it.  From Bangkok, I will take the overnight train up north to Chiang Mai to do a three day trek to a tribal village.  I will stay in Chiang Mai untl Saturday then come back to Bangkok to pick up Jen and head to Cambodia.  We are going to Angkor Wat and not sure where else, the backpacker acker way.  Wing it as we go.  I will update this site Jan 18th with details from my tribal village trek.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crazy, today is my birthday, and instead of spending it drinking at a bar in Chicago or Detroit, or Maui, I&#8217;m online reminiscing on my past 5 months in Korea.  I&#8217;ve lived a damn good, blessed, life so far.  I can think back the past 4 or 5 birthdays and the places I&#8217;ve spent them and it still amazes me.  This time last year I was in Havana, with Cubans as we all got to drinking and celebrating my 25th.  5 years ago, I was being carried back to my dorm by some Aussies in Sydney, Australia for my 20th.  I don&#8217;t know who reads this, or what they read it for, or if they get anything out of it.  But at the risk of sounding selfish, writing on this thing does me wonders and I love every minute of it.  When I started writing this post, I thought to myself, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t feel like writing on this thing anymore.&#8221;  After spending the past 60 minutes writing about my time here so far, my trip ahead, and my family I miss a lot, I remember why I am living this lifestyle again, and I love it.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m getting my damn backpack loaded, I&#8217;m going to Thailand baby!</p>
<p>Peace and love from my friendly apartment community,</p>
<p>backpacker acker</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>When I last left you all, which was probably months ago, as I&#8217;m pretty slow to update this website&#8230;we were trying to organize a trip to the world&#8217;s 7th most populous city, 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the world, Seoul, South Korea.  We decided just winging it and hopping on a train to the third largest city in the world with no plan wasn&#8217;t a great idea so we did do a bit of planning, contrary to the backpacker acker way.  I don&#8217;t know why but when scanning through the guide book, a guest house called &#8220;The Bong House&#8221; jumped out at us. (ok, I do know why)</p>
<p>We booked three rooms and the five of us set off from Busan, heading north 340 kilometeres (205 miles) to Seoul.  The train that carries you there is an airplane with no wings, and it doesn&#8217;t leave the ground&#8230;ok&#8230;and it has no jet engines, the seats recline, there are no oxygen tanks, and no flight attendants telling you not stop drinking screwdrivers and taking your shirt off&#8230;.wait&#8230;that doesnt happen to everyone?   But besides that stuff, it&#8217;s basically an airplane.  Here look, my friend Jason is such a skilled photographer, he managed to snap a shot of the train passing us at a whopping 310 km/hr.  Damn this guy is good.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2620.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2620.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2620.jpg" alt="img_2620.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>But in all seriousness, the train reaches speeds of 300+ km/hr.  When you are looking out the window at the passing countryside, it looks as though you are at the end of a runway and should be taking off at any second.  I don&#8217;t know about you all, but its the point during take-offs when I look outside, get really nervous and start saying &#8220;Why the f havent we taken off yet?  Is this guy driving me to Los Angeles?  This runway has to be ending soon!   God, I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t know detentions were a bad thing!  Please forgive my sins!!!&#8221;  You know that&#8217;s when my palms get sweaty, I grasp the arm rests in a deathgrip and the little grandma next to me just smiles and watches.  Then we finally lift off with out incident and I pretend to play it cool even though my shirt is now soaked with sweat and my heart is beating so hard I&#8217;m wondering if 25 year old dudes can have heart attacks.  Did I mention I hate flying?</p>
<p>The bullet train experience consisted of lots of Soju drinking and playing cards.  I volunteered to sit in the next row back because only 4 people were allowed at each table and well, I wanted to re-create my entire high-school experience in one train ride.  Nothing like watching people having fun from a safe, awkward distance.  ahhh high schoool&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t hear what my friends were talking about so I&#8217;d drink my Soju, lunge my hand forward with an empty cup over the seat and request a &#8220;fill-up&#8221;  By the 90 minute mark of the 3 hour journey, I was convinced the Korean 2 month-old baby behind me was speaking English to me.  I swear he was saying English words, but it must have just been my imagination.  Maybe that&#8217;s it though&#8230;maybe when English babies make all those crazy noises, they are speaking Korean and vice versa.</p>
<p>We arrived into Seoul 3 hours later and found our Bong House with out incident.  The man who worked there was a cheerful fellow, almost to the point you thought we really were in a &#8216;bong&#8217; house and he had just come from the &#8220;bong room&#8221; but alas this is Korea and thus impossible.</p>
<p>That night we went out to an area of Seoul that is known for foreigners (Americans) and shopping, not two of my most favorite things in the world&#8230;We were amazed to walk around and notice that at an inch under 6 foot and a whopping 160 lbs, I was the smallest man within miles.  All around us were large large men with arms the size of my head with more tattoos than a Harley gang.  It turns out this is where the United States Marine Corps goes to have a good time, as well as puke in the street, fight each other, run from Military Police, and flex.  I had heard of the military curfew, so we ducked into a hole in the wall until they were all back in their &#8220;barracks&#8221; and we could roam the streets with out fear of a random fist fight of which we would have gotten crushed.  It also didn&#8217;t help that Dave, the Englishman in our crew was walking around in his thickest Briitish accent saying &#8220;hello!  fancy some tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next night we went to the Billy Joel concert, dubbed Joel in Seoul (by us).  I&#8217;m not a huge Billy Joel fan but I do like most of his music and the tickets were only 35,000 won (roughly 20 US dollars).  Our seats were remarkably good, off the side a bit, maybe 30 rows back.  He came out and was fairly ornery, yelling directions to faceless roadies off-stage and sarcasticly remarking to the crowd &#8220;Does anyone here even speak English?&#8221;  In fact, in the middle of &#8220;River of Dreams&#8221;  (a great song)&#8212;security had spontaneously decided that people could no longer stand in front of the stage and had started to disperse them when Joel immediately stopped the song, stood up, yelled at security and flailed his arms like a baby who had just had his candy cane taken from him.  (Youtube search Billy Joel Seoul and you should be able to find a video of his temper tantrum).    We eventually made it to within 15 feet of the stage, due to what we shall call &#8220;whimpy security.&#8221;  Here is our view&#8230;<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2613.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2613.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2613.jpg" alt="img_2613.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>That night ended with some drinks and stumbling through Seoul until we found our hostel.  When we left our hostel for the concert that night, we had one roommate, a strange fellow named &#8220;Mantis.&#8221;  I wanted to ask him if he knew there was actually an insect in English named the praying mantis, but I didn&#8217;t want to piss this guy off.  He was from Lithuania and was only in Seoul on a visa run from Japan.  When we came back the next morning there was a random guy and a girl in the bed below me.  At 7 a.m, the cheery hostel worker came in and tried to wake him to no avail.  Later, upon awakening at 10:30 a.m. this was our conversation:</p>
<p>Weird guy:  Dude, what time is it?<br />
Me:  Uh, it&#8217;s 10:30 man.<br />
Weird guy:  Oh shit, did I miss the DMZ tour?<br />
Me:  What time was it at?<br />
Weird guy:  7:15 a.m.<br />
Me:  Uh, yeah, I&#8217;m pretty sure you missed it.<br />
Weird guy:  Aw shit man!<br />
Me:   Yeah, your laying on my jeans, can I have them?<br />
Weird guy:  (sleeping again)</p>
<p>The return trip home was uneventful, no Korean babies speaking English, no Soju drinking contests, just a really fast train taking us home&#8230;</p>
<p>A few odds and ends&#8230;(Sorry for the length of this post, if it&#8217;s too long, print it out and take it to the John if you must, if my friends had enough money to buy printers, I&#8217;m pretty sure most of them would have already done this)</p>
<p>I went to the United Nations Korean War Memorial in Seoul due to the fact mostly that my grandfather served in the Korean War or the &#8220;Forgotten War.&#8221;  Over 50,000 U.S. soldiers died in the Korean war, 50,000, think about that for a second.  It is a remarkable war to read about, and I encourage all of you to do so.  If you read just a tiny bit about it, it&#8217;s amazing how close this peninsula was to being under total North Korean and China&#8217;s communist rule.  The fact that my grandfather was sent to Busan 50 years ago and I am now teaching the grandchildren of the people he fought to protect is something that is pretty special, at least I think so.<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2570.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2570.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2570.jpg" alt="img_2570.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a><br />
For my Native English Club, an English after school club I started at my elementary school, I decided it was time the children of South Korea try one of my most favorite meals ever, Grilled Cheese.  It started off great, with each child trying a half of a sandwich, soon thereafter, it all went downhill&#8230;here&#8217;s a sample:</p>
<p>(student Kim John Gyeung walks up to me)<br />
Kim:  teacher, I want more.<br />
me:  Great!  so you liked it?<br />
Kim;  teacher, can I have grilled cheese sandwich, no cheese?<br />
me:  So you want bread and butter?<br />
Kim: oh yes teacher!  thank you so much!<br />
(7 more students come up to me with same request)</p>
<p>So grilled cheese wasn&#8217;t a big hit, I didn&#8217;t care though because I ended up making myself 6 sandwiches and quietly meandered the hallways of the school until I was alone in my teacher&#8217;s lounge taking care of the &#8216;leftovers&#8217;.</p>

<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2683.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2683.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2683.jpg" alt="img_2683.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>I also went on a hike today, it was a 5 mile hike on one of the bigger mountains in the city.  The fact that it was 60 degrees a week before Christmas and beautiful sun shining all day made the hike that much better.  Here are some shots from the hike&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2704.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2704.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2704.jpg" alt="img_2704.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>Fancy a game of footie?</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2713.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2713.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2713.jpg" alt="img_2713.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>

<p>my city</p>
<p>This website/blog will get very lively come three weeks.  In three weeks, I will be taking off towards Thailand and Cambodia.  Jan 9th I will arrive in Bangkok, spend a few days there and travel north 12 hours to a city called Chang Mai.  It is known for excellent trekking and is supposed to be very very different than the south of Thailand.  It is far more rural and has more of the Thai culture.  I will spend a week up there visiting as many different villages/cities as I can.  January 16th, I will head down to Bangkok to meet Jen and we will grab a bus heading towards Siem Reap in Cambodia.  We would like visit Angkor Wat, ancient ruins dating back to the 12th century, we will sample the Cambodian food, culture, and whatever else we can find.  From there we will head to Southern Thailand where we will enjoy our 16 day stretch island-hopping around the Thai islands.  We have been around little Korean children for 4 straight months and now need a hammock, many beers, 87 degree weather, and amazing Thai food.  From there I will be back for school February 9th.  A month paid vacation in Thailand?  Shit, I wasn&#8217;t getting that in Chicago.</p>
<p>and of course&#8230;I can&#8217;t leave you all without something so ridiculously Korean that it should at least make you smile&#8230;sometimes Korea, or any country for that matter you are traveling to are so different from what you know, it&#8217;s best not to judge and best to just accept it/them for what they are&#8230;(hell, that&#8217;s the art of traveling)  well in this case, forget that,  let&#8217;s all judge these people for one quick second when it comes to the style of their pets&#8230;</p>
<p>wait for it&#8230;</p>
<p>keep waiting&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2698.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1229256121]" title="img_2698.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2698.jpg" alt="img_2698.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>(yes ladies and gentlemen, that is a cat, and yes, it is shaved and has pink cheeks and pink tail)</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>It would be remiss of me to not give the most historically significant moment of my life a proper blog post.  However, as this is a travel blog and not a political blog, I&#8217;d like to keep my thoughts and comments focused on what this moment means not so much to average Americans, but to the rest of our brothers and sisters living around the world.   As an American living abroad and spending a significant portion of my last 6 years wandering the earth, I thought my perspective might be a bit different than others in that respect.</p>
<p>This was the first election I had ever experienced from abroad, let alone someplace as far away and as &#8220;different&#8221; as South Korea.  Walking around the city, there was no buzz in the streets like I&#8217;m sure there was in the U.S.  Korea is a very nationalistic country with relatively few imports (hardly any from the US) as they tax their imports heavily to encourage the patronage of their national companies.  That said, being in Korea, one wouldn&#8217;t have known that yesterday was the most significant election in modern history.</p>
<p>Most Americans I know in Korea coincidentally developed a &#8220;stomach bug&#8221; on the day of the election and thus &#8220;had&#8221; to call in sick.  Miraculously, my &#8220;stomach bug&#8221; felt so much better after I phoned in sick and I was able to follow the NBC news feed live on my computer.  A friend came over and there were three Americans living in this crazy country watching our homeland vote, huddled around a computer, eating French (freedom) Toast and thinking there was no way Americans could screw this up three elections in a row (so much for objectivity in this post).</p>
<p>When the news came in, &#8220;Barack Obama Elected President&#8221; it was surreal.  I had so little confidence he would actually pull it off due mostly to how ignorant our country can be at times&#8212;we sat back cracked some rice wine and relaxed knowing full well our country had just voted for change and essentially &#8220;rejected the Bush legacy.&#8221;   Bittersweet is a good adjective.  I was so happy and proud of what happened but so sad I couldn&#8217;t spend it with my friends in Chicago.  Seeing that speech being broadcast all around the world, sitting there recognizing every building and every park feature that I have spent the last two years cycling in, around, and through, I had one of those &#8220;what the hell I am doing in Korea?&#8221; moments.</p>
<p>But all is well, for we make decisions in life and have to live with those decisions and hope they were the right ones.  I still like being in Korea and hopefully, my strong desire to come back home and celebrate will fade over the next few weeks and I can appreciate the good and bad that being in Korea during this historical time offers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to speak to what this election means to Americans abroad, because that&#8217;s what I am.  I won&#8217;t be paying income tax next year (because of my work in Korea, not because Im a delinquent) so the tax arguments and debates hold very little significance for me.  That said, I do have my opinions on taxes, domestic policy, health care,. but this is not the place for such opinions.</p>
<p>I was in Auckland, New Zealand the day we invaded Iraq, just finishing a 4 month trip through Australia, New Zealand and some South Pacific Islands.  It was on that day I first learned what it meant to be ashamed of your country.  As the New Zealand news broke for a special announcement from American president George W. Bush, I set down my pool stick and backed away from the table, knowing what was about to be said.  After the announcement, I no longer felt comfortable in arguably the most peaceful nation in the world, New Zealand.  This was the start of a long six year stint of wandering into bars through out the world, hoping to God that they wouldn&#8217;t ask where I&#8217;m from, which then is usually followed a stern lecture or an invite to debate American policy abroad.</p>
<p>I was in Australia once and &#8220;Born in the USA&#8221; came on the jukebox, a large Australian man walked calmly up to the jukebox, punched it square in the screen and the entire machine shut off and the bar went dead silent.  He then turned to the crowd who was staring cautiously at him and in a thick Aussie accent &#8220;not gonna play that shit in my country, god damn USA.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was singing Keareaoke with three classmates in Canberra, Australia, the capital, when we were attacked by 5 Arab men who didn&#8217;t like the selection of our American songs.  To say those days are gone would be naive, but with a new leader in tow, we are heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>As Obama said in his speech&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I get goosebumps thinking about people huddling around a radio in a small village in Namibia listening to Obama&#8217;s every word, restoring some hope they thought was long lost.</p>
<p>I know Obama has his flaws and is by no means the perfect candidate.  I&#8217;m not sure there is even such thing as the perfect candidate.  The American people still donated ungodly amounts of money to Obama, money that other countries would kill for to build hospitals, schools, roads.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the campaign finance system in the U.S.  But like my wise uncle said &#8220;When you&#8217;re drowning, you don&#8217;t really care who throws you the rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can tell you from experience how much the rest of the world has hated us in the past eight years.  It gets downright tiresome, even in Turkey, a staunch American ally, Noah and I had to tell people we were from Canada because we were sick and tired of the debates and looks.  I think if more Americans traveled, (only 50% of Americans even have passports, that is laughable) George Bush would have never been elected to a second term.  So to me, this election is more than just remarkable for African Americans, poor Americans, sick Americans.  Along with those people, this election means so much to people all over the globe, and that cannot be understated.</p>
<p>This election was for Manuel, my friend in Cuba, who despises Bush foreign policy that is so hurting his nation and his ability to feed his family.  This election was for my people in Southern Mexico whose land is being exploited by big business that has their hands in the Republican party&#8217;s pocket.  This election was great for most Americans, but don&#8217;t ever forget about how this election has more importantly had a profound effect on the rest of the citizens of this globe.</p>
<p>For people who travel, it is a common thought upon return to your home country, &#8220;wow I&#8217;ve changed for the better, but everyone else back home just seems the same.&#8221;  Well I&#8217;m honored now to think that upon my return to the States next year, it will be my country that has changed more dramatically for the better than I have.  These are my thoughts from abroad, written down on this blog as much for my memory as your enjoyment. I&#8217;m honored to have your hit on my website.  Now if you&#8217;ll be so kind to excuse me, I&#8217;ve got a fistful of quarters and a jukebox in my sights.</p>
<p>from the heavy fog of busan in this monumental week,</p>
<p>backpacker acker</p>

				<p>might as well get this out of the way for those who haven&#8217;t seen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9O3yYL0rYo" title="Backpacker Acker cycles Korea" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9O3yYL0rYo</a></p>
<p>ok im in frickin korea, just now back in my teacher&#8217;s lounge after an awesome (read: terrible) lunch of rice and some type of octopus legs.  so why not fill you all in?</p>
<p>why does my korean co-worker keep bringing me this yellow water and pouring it in my glass day after day!?!  it&#8217;s clearly not water and it&#8217;s definitely not lemonade, so what the hell is it?  sometimes i drink it and try to convince myself its just water that someone, somehow, spilled harmless yellow dye into.  well it tastes like the water in my fishtank (dont ask how i know) and im putting a stop to these yellow water shennanigans.</p>
<p>usually, i smile, take a few sips, make a terrible face, wait until she turns her back, beeline for the bathroom and dump the&#8212;we&#8217;ll call it pee-water for lack of a better term, into the sink.  the problem i have created for myself is that she must think i love the shit because my glass is now always empty,leaving her to think im gulping it down and now doubles as my personal water-boy.  i wish i was meaner, i really do, but i just don&#8217;t have the heart to break hers.  my other co-teacher said it best last week when she was given some of the pee-water, &#8220;this taste berry muchy like pipe&#8221;</p>
<p>so when your water is described by other koreans as &#8220;pipey&#8221;&#8212; houston you might have a problem.  on a side note, i think all koreans should have to take &#8220;shopping cart driving tests&#8221; before they are allowed to walk around a store with 300 people controlling a large metal cart.</p>
<p>sports fans will like this&#8212;karim garcia is a former detroit tiger back when the team was terrible.  well karim garcia is now playing for the Lotte Giants, the local baseball team here in Busan.  They are bottom-feeders year after year, the kansas city royals of Korean baseball.</p>
<p>my friends and I were at an Oktoberfest in a local hotel and they informed me that some guy named &#8220;garcia&#8221; entered into an arm-wrestling tournament and he plays baseball.  after further questioning, i found out it was indeed Karim &#8220;the latino bambino&#8221; garcia himself.  (thanks nate fridson)</p>
<p>turns out he lost in the first round to an &#8220;overweight Korean.&#8221;  so there you have it folks, how do you know you have hit rock-bottom?  you are a former major league baseball player, playing for the worst team in Korean baseball history, and just lost an arm-wrestling match to a fat Korean dude in a hotel in Busan, South Korea.  Karim, it can only go up from here buddy.</p>
<p>ok since you last heard from me, I was trying to go Seoul to tour the DMZ among other things.  well, all who know backpacker acker, know that planning isn&#8217;t one of my strong suits, ok forget strong suits, i simply don&#8217;t know how to plan.  The only thing that happens when you plan is plans get broken, if you never make plans, you never break em?  pure genius.</p>
<p>we decided that instead of going to seoul where the dmz tour was booked, hotels were filled,  and a good chance the weekend might end up with us sleeping in a seoul subway station, we decided to head to gyeonju, a city an hour north of us, rich in history.  The Shilla Dynasty ruled here for thousands of years before being destroyed by Romans, Japanese and whoever else wandered down the peninsula.  Gyeongju (im going to spell it different everytime so deal) has temples, tombs, pagodas, and lots of greenery.  (not that kind stephen)<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2322.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics144]" title="img_2322.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2322.jpg" alt="img_2322.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="274" width="364" /></a></p>
<p>the other reason gyeongju sounded so appealing was the fact that lonely planet stated you could rent a bicycle and cycle anywhere in Gyeongju.  Now, what Lonely planet should have said is &#8220;you can cycle anywhere in Gyeongju, if you a) are Lance Armstrong, b) take massively unhealthy amounts of steroids or c) have a motor on your bicycle.<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2333.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics144]" title="img_2333.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2333.jpg" alt="img_2333.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a><br />
so we arrived in the town, and set out looking for some sort of lodging.  This place has millions of motels and one backpacker hostel.  It was the kind of place a guy can go with out making any plans, my kind of town.  Just pop into town, start strolling around, and find a place to lay ya head for the night.  Jen and I found a motel that looked decent but was sold out, turns out some people did make &#8220;plans&#8221; or whatever.</p>
<p>we found the only backpacker hostel in the town and went in and paid for the only room left:    a glorious mountain view with a private balcony overlooking a flowing river and rice paddie.  Im joking, it was a moldy mattress on the floor of a room whose wallpaper was making an escape towards the floor.  just had to do the age-old, drink until you don&#8217;t realize where you are sleeping routine, wake up in the morning, (hopefully still drunk) and get the hell outta there&#8230;all before you realize where you just slept.</p>
<p>we rented two bicycles and biked 4 miles to a nearby lake.  It had some type of crazy concert going on that we wanted nothing to do with.  It also had 3000 little children riding motorcycles.  Im not exagerrating or kidding, they were little dudes riding miniature motorcycles. how the hell they stayed up and didnt crash all the time with no training wheels is beyond me.  these kids have a gift, although the whole time I was walking around, I kept thinking to myself I wonder how much blowing your ACL out really hurts&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2346.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics144]" title="img_2346.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2346.jpg" alt="img_2346.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>i wouldn&#8217;t mind one scar from korea, but something about sitting at the bar in Chicago when I get back and someone saying &#8220;dude nice scar, what happened?&#8221;  followed by me saying, &#8220;this four year old on a harley flat just took me out, he was big for a four year old though i swear!&#8221;  Im not sure that is a cool story.</p>
<p>this is why you should update your website right after a trip, im now cycling through my photos, drinking wine,  trying to remember how the hell we spent the next three days&#8230;</p>
<p>well we did go to a local park in Geoyongui (notice the spelling) to see the tombs of various Silla dynasty kings.  The line for one of the kings was damn near 1000 people, so we had to settle for just walking around the park, admiring the tombs.  here&#8217;s a photo&#8230;</p>
<p>We retired for the night after eating at a great restaurant in town, that served some Western style food which we always welcome (I will have a whole separate post for the food here, hint: it will be long and negative so come prepared with your drink of choice)</p>
<p>in the morning, we woke up early and headed back on our bikes.  the original plan was to cycle to the temple, then cycle back and head towards the other smaller temples, statues, tombs, etc.  we were probably riding for an hour or so and didn&#8217;t feel like we were remotely close to the temple and the grotto.  we were in search of Bulguksa Temple and Seokram Grotto (god i am butchering these words and i feel terrible, but theres no internet where I am right now)</p>
<p>i made the executive (and pansy) decision to pull the bikes over, chain em to a signpost and hail the next bus that passes us.  20 minutes of waiting, a bus finally stopped only to tell us we were on the wrong side of the wrong road.  We crossed the street and waited another 20 minutes, got on the bus and sat in the front two seats.  After the bus started heading in the direction we just came from, it was apparent we were on the right bus, heading the wrong way.  (the roads were complicated ok? im not an idiot)</p>
<p>The bus driver slammed on his breaks, let us off in the middle of some rice paddies and with his hands told us to wait for the opposite heading bus.  blah blah blah, the bus trip up the mountain that in no way could we have done on our 1994 huffys lead us to bulguksa temple.  we toured the temple which was all rebuilt after the Japanese destroyed it.  here you go&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2381.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics144]" title="img_2381.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2381.jpg" alt="img_2381.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>from the temple we did a two hour hike up the mountain to the seokram grotto, a giant buddha statue, the largest in Korea and labeled &#8220;Korea&#8217;s #1 National Treasure&#8221;<br />
Korea names everything their National Treasure, I think when Nicolas Cage released the movie &#8220;national Treasure&#8221; they must have let out a big d&#8217;oh. (i hate nicolas cage, but he was good in Lord of War)  can I rip on nicolas cage a little bit though?  hell last post, i had baywatch clips, this blog can&#8217;t get any worse&#8230;.can it?   how about face-off?  oh man, that movie will make you want to do something irrational.</p>
<p>did you know nicolas cage lives in a fake castle in Los Angeles?  but don&#8217;t worry he&#8217;s actually in the process of importing a REAL castle from europe to california.  &#8220;hi im nicolas cage, do you have room on your freighter for a castle?  no?  im nicolas cage god darnit, give me my castle! I was in Windtalkers!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you know he has a tattoo on his LOWER back of a monitor lizard wearing a top-hat.  I couldn&#8217;t make this shit up if I tried.  He made 20 million each on Snake Eyes, Windtalkers, and 16 million for gone in 60 seconds.  ok im done, i just felt like you all needed to know that stuff&#8230;.where the hell was i here?</p>
<p>ok right, we waited in line for an hour to see the grotto and I will say it was worth the wait.  We couldn&#8217;t take pictures in there because of the damage it might do, so this photo I can&#8217;t claim, but i&#8217;ll post it on here anyways and hope the author doesn&#8217;t have a good Jewish lawyer.</p>

<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/248px-seokguram_buddha.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics144]" title="248px-seokguram_buddha.JPG"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/248px-seokguram_buddha.jpg" alt="248px-seokguram_buddha.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="338" width="248" /></a></p>
<p>there&#8217;s something very cool about buddhism and my aim, once I get more free-time, is to look into it quite a bit.  it seems like a fascinating religion, although i&#8217;m not sure I could give up alcohol, if only for the liveliness it provides for my website.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t be shy, if i havent talked to you in a while, leave a yo on my website.  I really have no idea who is reading this thing.  make a funny joke at my expense or not, you are my friend, make an unfunny joke, be prepared to be banned.</p>
<p>that last night we drank Japanese beer (dont tell any of my korean friends), rode our bicycles around the town, and caught a bus back to Busan.  It was an adeventurous weekend, it wasn&#8217;t seoul, but after we got there, we didn&#8217;t want it to be.</p>

<p>Side note:  I&#8217;m not into praying and all that jazz, but two backpackers&#8212;a couple&#8212;were beaten and the girl raped in a town in Northern Ecuador four days ago.  They are from Bend, Oregon, sold all their belongings and took a trip through Latin America for one year before they got married.  They are in their mid-20&#8217;s.  The guy is in critical condition with 24 stab wounds.  backpackers, much like any passion, or profession, are a close-knit community.  We pride ourselves on being the anti-Sarah Palin, the people who go out there and see the world, to open our minds, expand our horizons.  so, if you want, or would like to, think about those people and focus some good thoughts and energy that he survives.  They probably are the kind of people we desperately need more of in the good ol&#8217; USA.</p>

				<p>Busan, South Korea-</p>
<p>Many would have you think Backpacker Acker is incapable of teaching and molding the minds of young Koreans&#8230;</p>
<p>This video proves otherwise&#8230;If anyone knows how to get the video directly on the site, that&#8217;d be super.  WordPress blows.  (Please don&#8217;t delete my website WordPress, I didn&#8217;t mean it I swear!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgUkcusojcw" title="Backpacker Acker teaches Koreans how to dance." target="_blank">Backpacker Acker teaches dance lessons!</a></p>
<p>Now, let me be clear, they asked for &#8220;talent show time&#8221; I merely obliged.  I am in no way responsible for the actions of my classroom, oh wait, I am?  Shoot.  How do I get this link out of this website!?!  ay caramba</p>
<p>Anyway, I will post more videos soon, but this gives you, my loyal reader, an idea what a typic&#8212;I mean rare day is at my school.  My children know that if this video makes it to my principal, they will be forced to run wind sprints up the mountain every morning, fetch goat&#8217;s milk from a wild goat, bring it back to class, pastuerize it in class, pour chocolate cocoa mix into it and serve it to me warm while saying &#8220;teacher Jared, you are so handsome&#8221; for the rest of the semester.  Now that&#8217;s what I call fresh chocolate milk.  Now whose a tough teacher?</p>
<p>I think this is becoming a rather silly post, so I must remain focused and let you all know what I have been doing the last two weeks&#8230;Must remain focused&#8230;whiskey in sight&#8230;stay  focused&#8230;</p>
<p>I tried, I really tried,  but  the whiskey was mocking me.  Lord help us for the rest of this post.</p>
<p>South Korea actually has a live T-REX.  He lives in here&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2262.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics132]" title="img_2262.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2262.jpg" alt="img_2262.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>Who wants dinner?</p>

<p>I want you all to meet my favorite student.  Apparently teachers aren&#8217;t supposed to have &#8216;favorites&#8217; but those are American teachers.  Moo-Chi, I call him the &#8220;Moo&#8221; and he doesn&#8217;t answer me, but I think this nickname will catch on eventually.</p>
<p>Moo-Chi visits me every morning before class and we talk about absolutely nothing.  Our conversation usually goes something like this:</p>
<p>(Moo-Chi skips in accidentally because he forgot where his real class is and the conversation begins)</p>
<p>BPA:  Anyan-a-seo Moo-Chi  (Hello Moo)</p>
<p>MC:  Hello teacher.</p>
<p>BPA:  Hello Moo-Chi</p>
<p>(Moo-Chi does not like to, for some reason, show his back to me, when Moo-Chi thinks the conversation is getting stale, usually 10 seconds in, he slowly backs away until he is out of sight and runs down the hall)  It&#8217;s by far the best part of my day and darnit I love the kid.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2274.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics132]" title="img_2274.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2274.jpg" alt="img_2274.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>Last weekend we finally made it to the beach.  It&#8217;s about a thirty minute subway ride to the beach from our apartment.  It&#8217;s called Haeundae beach and there is actually surfing there.  It will also be the main home for the Pusan International Film Festival that runs from October 2-12 and showcases moves from over 73 different countries.</p>
<p>The Koreans are somewhat comical when it comes to beach attire and beach behavior.  I went in the water while waiting for Jen to arrive and was playing in the smallish waves that were crashing.  Some waves got to the 4 foot range, while most others were knee-slappers.  The fact that I was out where the waves were crashing was astonishing to them.  I&#8217;m pretty sure they thought I was David Hasselhoff.</p>
<p>For real though, if you want to laugh, you can spend hours on this site, I mean hours!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidhasselhoff.com/" title="The Hoff" target="_blank">David Hassellhoff!!!!!</a></p>
<p>Ok, you know you all want it, so here it is&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuYrRebvFHc" title="BW" target="_blank"> Baywatch </a></p>
<p>Good Lord how this blog post has lost its way&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Haeundae beach&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2278.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics132]" title="img_2278.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2278.jpg" alt="img_2278.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>I have also started to play basketball here in Busan.  I play two times a week and average 256 rebounds a game and 89 shots blocked per game.  They call me White Shaq.</p>
<p>I will post pictures of the courts later&#8230;</p>
<p>Last weekend we went out with friends (yes we are making friends) and went to Gwangali beach, the South Beach of Korea.  It is right on the ocean and has a giant bridge that changes color every minute.  It&#8217;s quite the scene and very different from our working class neighborhood where we live.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/dscn0757.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics132]" title="dscn0757.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/dscn0757.jpg" alt="dscn0757.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>Today, we went to Busan Tower.  It&#8217;s one of the largest buildings in Busan and overlooks Busan Harbor, which is the largest port in Korea, second largest in Asia.  This is a statue of Admiral Yi, he defended the Korean peninsula against the Japanese empire in the 16th century and died as he was chasing down the retreating enemy.  He had never lost a battle in seven tries.  In the background, is Busan Tower.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/dscn0768.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics132]" title="dscn0768.JPG"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/dscn0768.thumbnail.jpg" alt="dscn0768.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="600" width="449" /></a></p>
<p>Here we are at the top of the Tower, don&#8217;t mind the man in the background, he lost his dog, Neemsu, and was looking for him.</p>

				<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">Busan, South Korea&#8212;If you dont like being stared at, South Korea just simply isn&#8217;t the place for you.  I&#8217;ve been to a handful of countries the past five years and I&#8217;m quite used to being stared at, but South Koreans bring staring to a whole new level.  In New York City, or anyplace in the world for that matter, if you get caught staring at someone, usually you would look away quickly, as to not be rude.  Here?  No, they&#8217;ll just keep staring at you as if there is a giant pig doing the hula in a grass skirt directly behind your head that they are dying to see. I haven&#8217;t found out the way to combat this staring &#8220;showdown,&#8221; but I&#8217;ve got a few ideas. 1) Paint mean-looking eyeballs on my eyelids so when I catch them staring I&#8217;ll just shut my eyes&#8212;BAM, it might freak them out no?2) Stare back and engage in a staring contest of a lifetime (these dudes have a lock-down on the world&#8217;s best starers (is that a word?)</span></p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">I am teaching 4th, 5th, and 6th grades, while Jen is teaching 7th, 8th and 9th grades.  We will report more on the actual kids later. After walking the 20 minutes to my school from my dong,  (that just sounds wrong)  I walked into the courtyard of the school only to be swamped by school children saying &#8220;hi&#8221; &#8220;nice to meet you&#8221; and &#8220;david beckham!!!&#8221;  (my head is shaved now)Jen and I simply cannot go anywhere with out someone attempting to speak english to us, or coming over to say hello.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">The cab driver who took us back to our dong from the market was overly-excited to get me in the front seat of the taxi while Jen stayed in the back.  I thought he was just friendly at first, but little did I know he had ulterior motives.  Turns out he was a afficionado of people with blonde hair on their arms.  Lucky me, my blonde arm hair was now one foot from his reach and he had no qualms about reaching over, rubbing and playing with my arm-hair while he drove.  </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">Jen thought it was hilarious as he spoke no english whatsoever and was now asking to see my chest-hair.  I obliged and showed him my chest, he was less-than impressed, I guess I wasn&#8217;t nearly as hairy as he had hoped.  Oh well!  I was just happy he stopped asking to see my body hair at my chest. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">I was told by my co-teacher that I would attend a ceremony with all 1200 of the children in the school.  It was being held in the courtyard overlooking a giant valley, filled with high-rising apartments and those ominous green mountains in the background.  Quite a setting.  The ceremony started and the principal (whom I had met earlier and speaks zero english, a common theme) marched out.  When I say marched, I mean marched.  Apparently, my principal was in the Army back in his heyday.  Well, he still thinks he is in the Army, because he had these kids marching in beat, standing at attention, then at-ease, then bowing on command.  My co-teacher told me that before he arrived at the school, it wasn&#8217;t nearly as strict, the children would stand where they wanted.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">These children were lined up 20 deep in symetrical lines according to height.  It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.  Now, according to my co-teacher, also my translator, he was about to introduce the new teachers.  The first three Korean teachers were announced to minor applause, and then it was my turn.  Now don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m tootin my own horn here, but the applause I got was something out of an NSync (are they still alive?) concert.  The girls were screaming in a high-pitched tone and the boys were yelling and applauding.  I wanted to grab the microphone and scream out &#8220;Thank you Busan!&#8221; but I held back. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">The General, I mean the principal decided I should say a few words and the co-teacher told me to head to the podium that was elevated thirty feet off the ground in front of the student body.  They applauded as I came to the podium and I think I began to faint.  The grey sky turned black and I got light-headed.  I was standing in front of 1300 people in the middle of a mountainous valley, thousands of miles from my home and being asked to speak.  If I had a camera, this picture would be up on my wall, framed, until the day I die. I gripped the podium so hard I swear I thought I might destroy it.  I was afraid I was going to faint and fall over and have to be carried off the stage by 8 little Korean children.  It would have made for a great story at least.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">I started my speech with the obvious &#8220;Hello, my name is Jared Acker&#8221; which brought more applause.  The whole thing was compounded by the fact that when I said my first sentence, the echo over the giant speakers carried my voice clear across the valley, and I was now listening to myself speak 3 seconds after I said what I wanted to say into the microphone. I&#8217;m no public speaker, but I think I held my own once I got used to hearing my own voice and the delay.  I commented on how happy I was to be there, and ended it with &#8220;Kimsa-nida&#8221;  thank you in Korean, which brought the house down and sent chills through my body.  When you travel, there are moments you never forget, this was one.  In twenty years, wherever in the world I am, I will be able to sit back, pound a beer, and tell people the story of the day I gave a speech in front of 1200 in a valley on the Southern tip of the</span><br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Backpacker Acker is currently in the Republic of South Korea teaching English.  Check back next week for an update on the first week of South Korea.</p>
<p>The following is a report from the beginning of the trip.  Detroit to San Diego.</p>
<p>Well as many of you know, I have left Detroit and started my round the world trip.  My goal is to make it right back to the same spot in Detroit after circumnavigating the globe.<br />
Let me make a few statements about Chicago, both good and bad.<br />
I lived in Chicago for two years, not including random trips to Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic for an extended amount of time, so I got a good feel for the city.<br />
Let me start off with what I didn&#8217;t like about Chicago and maybe others can relate&#8230;those that know me, know i started the blue line revolution, a small grassroots movement to get people off the Chicago subways and onto their bikes.  It all started when I first moved to Chicago and the blue line train would run at approximately 5mph from my house to downtown.  I thought this was ridiculous and my answer was to form a now defunct softball team called the Blue Line Revolution.<br />
Well, the Blue Line Revolution went 1-6-1 and lost in the first round of the playoffs&#8230;.but the Blue Line dropped its 5mph zones and now cruises along speedily.  I dont know about you, but I think it was because of the softball team that the revolution prevailed.</p>
<p>So Chicago&#8217;s public transportation system is a joke&#8230;I have no idea how they could possibly upgrade or handle the amount of people that would be here if they win their olympic bid.  The whole system is a mess.  At times, the city made me so downright angry and frustrated I needed time away.<br />
It&#8217;s a city that is set up perfectly to have everyone on their bikes.  Instead people drive, stuff themselves in dirty trains, or take taxis to work.  There are bike lanes set up on hundreds of streets yet people haven&#8217;t caught on yet.  The other qualm I have with chicago is the extrodiarenly large amount of unhealthy people there are in the city.  Riding through downtown, it makes you sick.  I wonder if both of these problems are related?   I&#8217;m sure not&#8230;.(can you detect my sarcasm)</p>
<p>I could rip any city for hours, but until you&#8217;ve lived through a Chicago winter&#8230;.</p>
<p>There are a ton of excellent things about chicago.  It is by far one of the best sports cities I have ever been to.  The people still retain that midwestern friendliness about them.  It&#8217;s not uncommon to walk around a neighborhood and say hello to a passing stranger, something that is unthinkable in New York.</p>
<p>When summer rolls around Chicago is an amazing place.  Music festivals, neighborhood beer festivals, parades, art fairs, beer festivals,  you name it.  They even have a &#8220;beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>All said, I wouldn&#8217;t trade my two years in Chicago for anything.  Met great people, got a master&#8217;s degree, and changed quite a bit as a person.  Two years was the perfect amount of time, I&#8217;m ready for a change&#8230;.so alas, a round the world trip first entry,  sit back and relax, you are about to join backpacker acker on another adventure.</p>
<p>After leaving Detroit and stopping through Chicago to see my friends and family for one last time in what could be quite a few months, I headed into the great cornfields of Iowa.  Passing through a storm that could have been a scene from &#8216;Twister&#8217; I drove until I couldn&#8217;t drive anymore and ended up stopping in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Staying in omaha for one night:  good/average idea</p>
<p>Eating mexican in omaha for one night:   very bad idea</p>
<p>Why I thought Omaha, Nebraska would have good Mexican food is beyond me.  lesson learned.</p>
<p>I ended up staying in Denver, Colorado with my mom for a week or so and took one day and went with my bro to Rocky Mountain National Park.  we did one hike to an elevation of 10,900 feet as shown below&#8230;the only animal we saw was on the drive in: a deer that almost got hit by oncoming traffic, but it was a beautiful park nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2010.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1220221713]" title="img_2010.JPG"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2010.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_2010.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After taking off from Denver we followed 1-70 through the Rockies until we reached Grand Junction, Colorado.  I&#8217;ll say quite a few people there resembled Joe Dirt but for some reason the women were all remarkably good looking.  weird.  of course at this point i could do the obligatory  &#8220;(my friends name) would love this place and would fit in so well!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2021.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics119]" title="img_2021.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2021.jpg" alt="img_2021.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>We finally arrived at Cayonlands National Park and reserved a campsite 500 feet from one of the massive canyons.  there werent many families and just 10-12 people in all of the area.  All real camper types with a real laid back vibe.  The only thing that wasn&#8217;t laid back that night was mother nature herself.  Black clouds were moving in around 8pm and when we went to sleep, it was relatively quiet.  That all changed in minutes as wickedly strong winds came in threatening to wipe away our shelter, aka my new tent.  I told my brother there were two things that would make me cry on this first leg of the journey, 1. my cannondale falling off the back of the car into highway traffic and 2. the wind destroying my tent when we are 12,000 feet up on some mountain in southern utah.  Luckily neither happened, and I still haven&#8217;t cried even one day in my life&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2041.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics119]" title="img_2041.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2041.jpg" alt="img_2041.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>We did a few hikes in Canyonlands and booked it the next day for Arches National Park where we did even more hikes&#8230;as it turns out, one of the major arches in the park had collapsed just twelve hours before our arrival.</p>
<p>here is a news article about it for those interested&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/10/arch.collapse.ap/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/<wbr></wbr>10/arch.collapse.ap/index.html</a></p>
<p>From there we drove through Beaver, Utah to Zion National Park and camped right inside the park&#8230;.Here&#8217;s the view from our campsite&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2045.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics119]" title="img_2045.JPG"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2045.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_2045.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>we stayed the night under the Zion stars admiring the meteor shower that takes place the second week of august every year.  the next morning, we did another hike and booked it for the west coast, stopping only in vegas to lose some money and complain how hot it was.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2106.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics119]" title="img_2106.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/img_2106.jpg" alt="img_2106.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="360" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>so the journey is underway, i passed through 8 states on my way to the pacific ocean and got to experience three of america&#8217;s national parks&#8230;not a bad start</p>
<p>check back soon this week to see how the Korean adventure began</p>
<p>your friend,</p>
<p>backpacker acker</p>
