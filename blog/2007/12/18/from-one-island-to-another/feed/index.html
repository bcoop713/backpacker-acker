		<description><![CDATA[I have to apologize for my misinformation, that&#039;s what you get for believing a Yankees fan.  

In addition, all of our relief work has been done in the Barahona area through out different Bateys in the region.  I haven&#039;t heard of any efforts of Lugo there but that does not mean he hasn&#039;t done quite a bit for that region that I just haven&#039;t heard of.  I will check into the subject with a few sources in Barahona and will report.  Thanks for the comments and support on the site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One more comment about Julio Lugo: You may be interested to know that within a week of the conclusion of the World Series, he was en route to the DR to help assess hurricane relief needs, particularly in Barahona, where he spent his childhood.  He and the Red Sox were also planning to match funds donated to the Red Cross (I&#039;m assuming in the Boston area, not sure of the details).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Found this while Googling info on Dominican baseball players.  I wanted to let you know that your buddy was misinformed about Julio Lugo&#039;s past, as the wedding party that you stumbled upon was that of his SECOND marriage.  He did run into legal trouble in 2003 following a dispute with his first wife, but was later acquitted of all charges.  It is telling that he and his new wife are raising the child born from his first marriage.  I&#039;m glad that you and your friend concluded that Lugo has changed his ways -- I have done a lot of reading on the subject and believe that your conclusion was correct.

I enjoyed happening upon this page and will probably be back to read more about your Latin American explorations.  Latin America is something that has piqued my interest recently, thanks to a renewed interest in baseball.  In particular, I would love to visit the DR someday.

Best of luck with your travels!]]></description>
