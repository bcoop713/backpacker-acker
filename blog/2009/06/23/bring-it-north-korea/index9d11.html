                    <div class="storycontent">
                        <p>Gone were the high-rise apartments only to be replaced by 40-foot guard towers occupied by ROK soldiers with M-16&#8217;s and binoculars.  Gone were the old Korean women elbowing you as they exit the bus, enter crew-cut screaming Corporals from the United States Army.  Vanished were the taxies, instead appeared camouflaged-laden jeeps acting as escorts.  As you might surmise from the previous statements, &#8220;we aren&#8217;t in Busan anymore!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, nobody was massively hung-over for this adventure to the most heavily armed border in the world.  This is a place where one small miss-step could land you on a live land mine or in the wrong &#8220;Korea.&#8221;  A place where one stare can cause an international incident, a place where tension is always in the air, and a place where the words &#8220;no pictures, no talking, no gestures&#8221; are as common as &#8220;hello, please, and thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our bus departed promptly at 0730 from the U.S.O office for the 70-minute ride north of Seoul to the De-Militarized Zone.  A 4-kilometer wide, 280-kilometer long stretch of essentially trees and mountains where no military equipment or personnel from either Koreas, or any nation for that matter, is allowed.  The result of this is an expansive area of teeming wildlife.  Beautiful white cranes flock at every turn, the shrubbery is extremely green and there are even relatives of the Siberian Tigers that live in the D.M.Z.  So if you had any inclinations that this would be a good spot to camp out for a week, think again.</p>
<p>The intensity of the situation hits not even 20 minutes after leaving Seoul.  Lining the highway to the DMZ is a 12-15 foot fence surrounded by barbed wire and protected by a South Korean watch-tower every 500 feet or so.  In each watchtower are 2 ROK (Republic Of Korea) soldiers with a large automatic mounted machine gun and binoculars, constantly on lookout for any incursion from the North.  They are protecting their &#8220;mother city.&#8221;  Seoul is the granddaddy of South Korea; consistently top five in the World&#8217;s Largest Cities.  The outskirts of Seoul sit just a handful of kilometers away from the D.M.Z. (at this area it is a large river).  The barbed-wire fence is lined with small white rocks that are stuck into various positions along the fence, every 3 feet or so.  The reason for this is that the ROK army can easily detect when someone has tampered with the perimeter fence as the rocks have been moved or adjusted in their positioning.  This is a method that is supposedly distinct to the ROK Army.</p>
<p>Our schedule would be as follows, a bus to Panjumon, where the JSA or Joint Services Area is located.  The JSA is located near Camp Bonifas, a military base operated by the United States Army and the Korean Army.  Soon enough, we had arrived at Camp Bonifas where our South Korean volunteer guide, Young, had to leave us (South Koreans aren&#8217;t allowed in the DMZ for any reason)  We switched busses to a United Nations bus that drove us inside the Joint Services Area accompanied by two loud U.S. Army soldiers.  Although it was pouring rain the entire day, the first soldier, a large Latino fellow insisted on wearing his Oakley sunglasses the entire time.  The second soldier, our guide, PFC Hauck, was a tall lanky fellow who seemed as if he was relatively new to the whole tour guide job.  That said, you would have thought these guys were taking us into battle, they screamed, yelled, shouted orders, and yelled some more when we didn&#8217;t listen.  They took themselves very seriously and that&#8217;s all I say on that.</p>
<p><em>Here is a picture of PVC Hauck struttin&#8217; his stuff&#8230; </em></p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4376.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1245758995]" title="img_4376.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4376.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_4376.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The grey large building behind me is North Korea.  The border is that small ledge you can see between the two blue buildings.  The South Korean soldiers stand like that so they cannot be sniped from North Korea.  (Don&#8217;t mind the guy with his back to North Korea, he was the f up in boot camp)</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4381.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1245758995]" title="img_4381.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4381.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_4381.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We were herded into a meeting room like cattle where we watched a really well done PowerPoint presentation complete with a horribly done talk over by PFC Hauck.  The dude was doing his best micro-machines commercial, only he wasn&#8217;t talking about little toy cars, he was talking about war, death, peace agreements, and other important stuff that would have been nice to hear.  I also noticed that the Corporal did not take off his sunglasses even when the lights were off.  (Don&#8217;t email me with &#8220;Maybe he had an eye disease, maybe he had a glass eye, and you should be more sensitive)  This guy thought he was the best thing since sliced bread and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say on that.</p>
<p>Our next stop would be the Joint Services Area where meetings are held between North and South Korea.  We walked through the Family Center which was set up to allow North Korean and South Korean families to visit one another but was never used because of the North&#8217;s fear that all the families would immediately defect.  When you walk out of the Family Center you are immediately staring at 4 or 5 small blue UN buildings sitting directly on the border between North and South Korea.  Past the buildings, is the North Korean building where the officials work.  Due to the fact that both Koreans are always trying to one-up each other, both the Family Center and the large North Korean building look very similar and were only allowed to be built to a certain height.  Otherwise, I&#8217;m quite sure the two largest buildings in the world would be at this location.</p>
<p>Looking across at the North Korean building, I immediately saw a North Korean soldier staring at us with his binoculars.  Then a second soldier came out and they chatted for a moment and shared the binoculars as they both stared at us.  This was not the time to make funny gestures, flip the bird, do a shimmy, or tell some Kim Jung Il jokes.  Inside the small window seen here, there are more North Korean soldiers snapping photos of everyone&#8217;s faces, running them in their computers presumably and using them for various propaganda videos through out their country.  I just hope they got my good side.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4386.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1245758995]" title="img_4386.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4386.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_4386.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey let me see those Mac&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4387.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1245758995]" title="img_4387.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4387.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_4387.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After the first group made its way out of the conference room sitting on the border, we were allowed to enter.  The room is divided by a conference table and is stationed by a South Korean soldier who will kick your ass if he feels it&#8217;s necessary.  The room is divided in half by an imaginary white line so that when the two countries meet, no North Korean ever has to come into South Korea and no South Korean has to enter the dreaded land of North Korea.  Why didn&#8217;t my mom think of this when my brother and me were growing up?  Either way, this is the only place in the world where you can enter North Korea legal territory and not be shot at.  Apparently, our group overstayed our allotted time because Private Hauck screamed, &#8220;no more pictures, move out!&#8221;  Only when people kept snapping (me included) I was given an earful of more yelling that immediately sent me back to high school football practice and I started to cry.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4393.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics-1245758995]" title="img_4393.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_4393.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_4393.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Back on the bus, we motored around the DMZ with an armed escort in the make of a camouflaged jeep with two ROK officers with M-16&#8217;s.  Winding down narrow paths of just trees and wildlife on each side, we were forbidden to take photos.  We saw minefields at every turn, guard-towers off in the distance.  We saw the place where the 1976 Axe murder took place, when the U.S. Army and the ROK Army attempted to cut down a large tree that was blocking their view of North Korea in the DMZ and a fight ensued between North soldiers and a U.S. Army officer was axed to death.  We also saw the place where in 1984, a Russian tourist, on a tour with a North Korean tour company, in an effort to start a new life, dashed across the border and onto the South Korean side.  North Korean soldiers quickly followed him and a firefight took place between armies of both countries right outside the Family Center.  Again, a few soldiers were killed on each side.</p>
<p>We went to one more observation point where we could see both peace villages.  The peace villages are actual villages that are located within the DMZ.  North Korea has one peace village and South Korea has one. Both of which are within direct viewing of one another.  Kijong on the North Korean side, is distinguishable by its giant 525 foot flagpole that flies a North Korean flag over 90 feet wide and weighing over 600 lbs.  In this village you can see large buildings with electricity and bright blue roofs that obviously aren’t how any people in North Korea live.  This was done on purpose to convince South Koreans to defect to North Korea.  Until 2004, they had large (and I mean large) loudspeakers in the &#8220;peace village&#8221; that broadcasted propaganda to the South enticing people to once again, defect.</p>
<p>Not able to back down from a comparative showdown.  The South founded Daeseong-dong, a peace village of their own.  The people who live here are Korean citizens but are exempt from all taxes and must be in their houses with the doors and windows locked by 6pm every night.  They must spend 8 months of the year in this village in order to qualify for tax-exemption and their children can attend any university in South Korea free of charge.  Originally, the flag on the North Korean side was only a mere couple of hundred feet.  South Korea&#8217;s peace village erected a larger flag and loudspeakers of their own in what must have sounded like two really large Korean giants arguing with each other across a 4-km section of trees and grass.  &#8220;You come to North Korea now!&#8221;  &#8220;No! You come back here to South Korea now!&#8221;  &#8220;South Korea have many karaoke songs&#8221;  &#8220;North Korea have&#8230;Kim Jung Il, you come now!&#8221;  You get the picture&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course naturally, this is when North Korea erected the world&#8217;s largest flagpole at 525 feet, not to be outdone by their brothers to the South.  I believe this is the equivalent of the sandcastle building competition we&#8217;ve all been in as kids with your sibling.  One brother builds a sandcastle, the other brother builds it bigger, and on it goes for an hour.  Only in this case, South Korea is the older, wiser, brother, who says, &#8220;Screw this, I&#8217;m going to talk to that girl over there&#8221; and walks away leaving his younger brother with the biggest sandcastle, because in the end, it&#8217;s a god-damn sand-castle.  So there is North Korea, the world&#8217;s largest flagpole but they can&#8217;t feed their people.  Way to get your priorities in order.  Though who am I kidding?  That flag was frickin sweet.</p>

<p><em> This is the &#8220;Bridge of No Return&#8221; where after the Korean War, POWs from each country couuld choose what country they could go to.  Naturally, whatever country they picked would be their choice for life with no possibility of return, hence the name. </em></p>

<p>The almighty flag of North Korea, hard to see with the fog that day.</p>
<p>Our escort led us to the exit of Camp Bonifas where Young, our guide, got us back on his crap-tacular bus and off we went to eat lunch at a restaurant near the DMZ.  All I can say about the lunch is anytime you walk into a male restroom outside of the only restaurant in town and the &#8220;number 2&#8221; toilets outnumber the &#8220;number 1&#8221; toilets 10 to 1, you might have just ate at the wrong restaurant.</p>
<p>We went to one more observatory which was just outside the DMZ but was too damn cloudy to see one thing.  Apparently on a clear day you can see one of the 50,000 statues erected to honor the Great Leader.  After the observatory, still raining mind you, we were able to tour a tunnel that was discovered in 1990 that the North Koreans had been building in order to a) defect to South Korea or b) the more likely one, invade South Korea.  There were four tunnels found in all, all coming from different points along the North&#8217;s DMZ and were all headed in the direction of Seoul.  Each tunnel could move approximately 30,000 soldiers over the course of an hour.  The tunnel was what you think it&#8217;d be like, dark, a lot of rocks, cold, drips of water falling on your head.  It was a 20-minute walk into the tunnel and then you&#8217;d turn around and go back.  We had to wear these dorky yellow construction helmets that seemed ridiculous at the time but turned out to be very helpful.  As we walked single file crouching in the 5-foot tall tunnel, you&#8217;d hear POP POP POP, all the yellow helmets banging up against the granite-laden ceiling of the tunnel.</p>
<p>We were back at the U.S.O. office by 3:30pm ready for a nap before our night out.  All in all, it was one of the highlights of my year in Korea.  This is more true given the timing, when every week North Korea is doing something provoking to other nations.  Be it testing nuclear weapons (people frown upon that surprisingly), launching &#8220;satellites&#8221; that look like missiles, or calling for war against their brothers to the South.  To be that close to soldiers of this feared regime, closer than most people in the world have been, was something that will at least make for a good story on a barstool somewhere the coming years.  And after all, isn&#8217;t making stories what life is all about?  So when I&#8217;m sitting at a bar in Chicago, Detroit, Hawaii, Paris, or Moscow and a newsflash comes up &#8220;Kim Jung Il testing bald eagles with grenade launchers&#8221; I&#8217;ll try not to smile because hell, I&#8217;ve seen his Army, and all they had were binoculars.</p>
<p>From the most heavily armed border in the world,</p>
