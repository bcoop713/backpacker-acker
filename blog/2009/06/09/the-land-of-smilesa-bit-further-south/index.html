                    <div class="storycontent">
                        <p>Making our way back to Koh San Road for one last time, we loaded up on any other necessary items we might need that would be too expensive in the outer reaches of the Andaman Islands.  This mainly consisted of bug-spray, (enough to coat an elephant 8 times over).</p>
<p>That night we caught a cab to the Bangkok Bus Terminal and boarded our bus bound for Phuket, a central hub of travel to the southern islands.  With our snacks in hand we boarded the bus and settled in for what would turn out to be one of the longer legs of our journey.  We were assigned a seat in the very last row so conveniently, or inconveniently, whichever way you see it, the bed of the&#8221;bus attendant&#8221; was right behind us.  My head was actually 4 inches away from her head, awkward a tad I&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>I had told Jen as we pulled out of the Bangkok Central Terminal that every kilometer we traveled south would become more and more Muslim.  We were now headed towards Malaysia and southern Thailand has a distinctly different feel than that of Northern and Central Thailand.  If Jen didn&#8217;t believe me when we were departing that it would become more Muslim, then at 3:15 a.m. when the bus rolled to a stop at a place I couldn&#8217;t even tell you, she definitely believed me.</p>
<p>Stepping off the bus we were no longer in Thailand.  Geographically speaking we were, but this was not the Thailand we had seen in pictures, and these people were not wearing beach clothes and most certainly were not drinking Pina Coladas.  We were now standing in a market with 400-500 Muslim men in full Muslim dress and not a woman in sight.  The market was full of action, people buying spices, snacks, drinks, and whatever else you can think of.  To state that we were stared at would the be equivalent of stating Mt. Everest is a hill, Michael Jordan is &#8220;pretty good,&#8221; and George W. Bush was a &#8220;bad&#8221; president.  Understatements of the century.</p>
<p>Jen did quite well under the circumstances, she had never traveled much before and this was her first true &#8220;traveling experience.&#8221;  I have only been to Israel and Turkey in the Middle East so I too, had very little experience being surrounded by this many Muslim men and being the only Westerner in sight.  This is to say nothing against Muslim men, except given the history between our respective cultures in the past 10 years, I cannot say I felt entirely safe.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how we ended up in this &#8220;oasis&#8221; of Islam.  I believe it was the fact that we decided to &#8220;cut back&#8221; on expenditures and go 3rd class down to Phuket and save the first class ticket for our ride back when we would be tired, tan, and hungover.  Therefore, riding third class allowed us to travel with other people making the trip to Malaysia or onwards to Indonesia, etc.  Phuket was simply a stop-over for these people as they had no intention of hitting the beaches of Koh Phi Phi with us.  It was an astounding experience to  say the least and I&#8217;m still quite glad we opted for third class.</p>
<p>One younger fellow, complete with a head-wrap and scraggly beard approached us cautiously.  We stood in one place for too long and now we were about to have a conversation with a man who had never spoken to a Westerner in his life.  As you might assume, he was incredibly nervous, after all I am quite an imposing figure.  Shaking and trembling quite visibly, he spoke softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, where are you from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Quick, say anything besides the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Us? oh! we&#8217;re from Canada eh!  (nervous laughter) definitely not from the USA!&#8221;</p>
<p>Small conversation for a few minutes about where we were going, what we study, led us to shaking hands with the man and departing our own ways.</p>
<p>I must recant, we did indeed see two other foreigners in the rest stop, they were within 1.5 feet of their bus&#8217; door and the woman looked as though she was in a sprinting position ready to pounce back into her seat in a moment&#8217;s notice.  They had a wide-eyed stare, a deer in the proverbial headlights if you will.  Only there was no car, only hundreds upon hundreds of Muslim men acting as the figurative beams of light.</p>
<p>It is sad that the media and our culture has made us cautious or afraid, for lack of a better word, of their culture.  I just finished reading &#8220;Three Cups of Tea&#8221; by Greg Mortenson a few months ago, and it really shows the Muslim world in a different light than what we are used to reading and hearing, I encourage you all to read that book.</p>
<p>Anyway, arriving at Phuket bus station at 8 a.m., we strapped up (our backpacks, not our guns) and started to head towards town to find a &#8220;cheap&#8221; place to bunk up for the night.  After 20 minutes of unsuccessful traversing the city, a man in a truck pulled up and asked us if we wanted to go to the Ferry station.  Now, I say, when a shady looking fellow in a run-down truck in the south of Thailand asks you to get in his truck, the only possible answer can be, &#8220;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Off we went for a few bucks to the ferry station where there were 4 or 5 large boats boarding their passengers for various islands.  Some were heading to Koh Lanta, Koh Phi Phi, Krabi, etc.  After bargaining for a ticket, we&#8217;d decided we&#8217;d head to Koh Phi Phi for a few days as everyone raves about the beauty of the island.</p>
<p>Stephen Stills once sang, &#8220;Got out of town on a boat, headin&#8217; for the Southern Islands&#8221; in what is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest songs ever written.  Now I can&#8217;t sing like Stephen, nor were we on a yacht like he undoubtedly was, but we were on our little twin hull ship heading towards the island of Koh Phi Phi.</p>
<p>After arriving at Koh Phi Phi, we found a small bungalow right near the port.  The bungalow looked relatively new because it was relatively new, though not for the right reason.  On December 26, 2004, (in case you&#8217;ve been in a coma) while I was drinking a beer in a Tel-Aviv youth hostel, a tsunami ravaged many countries through out Southeast Asia.  Nearly 4,000 of the 10,000 residents and travelers on the island of Koh Phi Phi were killed.  According to sources, 104 children lost one or both parents.  There is a popular book entitled &#8220;The Children of Phi Phi Island&#8221; which is a book created by the children recounting the disaster.  All proceeds go directly to non-profits set up to aid these new orphans.</p>
<p>Though the gravity of the situation does not hit you while you are traveling through Koh Phi Phi, upon return home, and looking at photos of the disaster which you now recognize easily, it strikes one hard.  Knowing that all the children I saw on that island were directly affected by that wave and lost someone so close to them is quite sad.  Volunteers and the government have set up an early warning tsunami system to alert residents and tourists alike as to a possible oncoming wave, so progress has been made.  Please check my photo galleries for full pictures of this island.</p>
<p>We spent the two days on Koh Phi Phi taking long-tail boats, which are long, wooden, boats with a outboard engine attached to a wooden rod extending from the back of the boat, to various parts of the island.  We&#8217;d long-tail it (it&#8217;s a verb too) to one beach, have a few drinks, then hire another boat to another beach, we eventually made it to &#8220;Monkey Beach.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll give you one guess as to why they call it monkey beach.</p>
<p>The monkeys aren&#8217;t cute little fuzzy monkeys that love humans and pose for pictures.  These are Chris Farley monkeys.  These monkeys have been fed non-stop for the past 10 years and have consequently developed pot-bellies and picky appetites.  Jen decided to feed one monkey bits of a banana, only this obese monkey had other ideas.  Jen handed, we&#8217;ll call him &#8216;Farley&#8217;, a piece of a banana, Farley took the piece, smelled it then tossed it to the sand.  Farley then walked up to Jen, pulled her hand down, grabbed the whole banana, backed away a few steps, took one bite of the banana then tossed the whole banana into the sand.</p>
<p>Farley then retreated into a nearby tree and waited for us to walk away while he eyed my backpack.  Once we were a few feet from the backpack, Farley&#8217;s fat butt waddled down the tree, grabbed my Gatorade bottle from my backpack, waddled back up the tree, unscrewed the gatorade bottle, took two giant swigs of &#8220;blue mountain&#8221; gatorade to finish off the bottle and threw it back at my feet.  What a punk that monkey was.</p>

<p>We hiked around Koh Phi Phi for a bit, had some nice dinner and retired for the night.  Our boat to Koh Lanta would leave at 9am the next morning.  On the boat ride to Koh Lanta, I made friends with one of the crew and he invited us to come sit in the captain&#8217;s deck of our 100 foot ship that was now motoring slowly to Koh Lanta.  The rest of this story will be published in my book.</p>
<p>Check out my sweet &#8216;stache.</p>

<p>One of the crew members on deck took us to his family&#8217;s bungalow hotel and we ended up staying there for one night.  It wasn&#8217;t a bad place, but it was located across the street from the beach and not on the beach.  The next morning we walked across the street and stumbled into our future home for the next two weeks.  The &#8220;Atcha Hut&#8221; was offering bungalows at  12 dollars per day, 75 feet from the crashing waves with nothing between us and the ocean but sand and two palm trees.  Here&#8217;s the view from our hut&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3474.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics212]" title="img_3474.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3474.jpg" alt="img_3474.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>Our buddy Jason met us there a few days later after we had discovered the best places to eat on the island, hired a moped for the two weeks, and bought copious amounts of drinks.  Jason and I eventually decided to buy a fishing rod so that we could try and fish right off the shore in front of the bungalow.   After we failed miserably at bargaining the price of the fishing rod down, we spent 50 bucks and sprung for it.  Little did we know, this would be the best thing we would buy in Koh Lanta.</p>
<p>Jason (naturally, if you know him) was late for our first fishing session at 7pm that night outside my bungalow.  (He stayed down the road at a different bungalow)  I rode my moped the 25 minutes into &#8220;town&#8221; to buy some shrimp and squid to use as bait.  I rigged up my line, waded out to my chest in the water, then gave it a great cast of epic proportions.  (actually I failed miserably on the first few casts, but that former sounds better)</p>
<p>Finally, after a good cast I was satisfied with, I sat back down on the sand, cracked open a 75 cent tall boy &#8220;Chang Beer&#8221; and took a sip from my beer.  I set the beer down and a small jerk was felt through my hands from the fishing line.  Swearing under my breath, I stood up and cursed the rocks that had already taken hostage of my precious bait, hook, and sinker.  Then another jerk, this time much harder.  For non-fishing folks, when a fish hits, you pull up hard on the rod to set the hook.  Out of  curiosity and anger at the rocks, I yanked up on my rod and felt immediate pressure followed by my line being pulled out to sea.  This was no rock ladies and gentlemen, in a whopping 20 seconds I had hooked a fish.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;d like to be able to say I played it cool and brought this baby in with little fanfare, but I&#8217;d be telling a giant lie.  Screaming at the top of my lungs, &#8220;Jen! Jen! Jen! I got something, bring the camera!&#8221; people must have thought my first born baby just drifted into the sea.  I would reel in the fish for a second only to have it run away with my line 10 seconds later.  I had a fight on my hands.  By now, a small crowd had gathered around the commotion.</p>
<p>Let me preface this next paragraph by stating that at no time did the thought ever enter my head that I would catch anything at all.  If fact, I was so convinced I wasn&#8217;t going to catch anything that that&#8217;s all I would tell anyone who would listen.  My pop-pop used to take me fishing off the Jersey shore every summer and not once did we ever catch anything.  We must have fished that shore 40 times and never a bite.  So I was preconditioned to believe nothing would happen.</p>
<p>So imagine my face, my excitement, my outburst of a cavemanesque scream as I reach in the water and grab a 1.5 foot, 15 lb Jack after fighting with it for nearly 2 minutes.  There really are few feelings better than catching a great fish like that.  Immediately the crowd around me was mesmerized, one 60 year old hippie who looked like he had been on Koh Lanta for the better part of the decade remarked &#8220;Shit, I&#8217;ve never seen anyone catch anything out here!&#8221;  The fish was absolutely beautiful.  Here&#8217;s a picture&#8230;</p>

<p>here&#8217;s the crowd gathered&#8230;(check out the hippie scratchin&#8217; his butt)</p>

<p>And ladies and gentlemen, here&#8217;s dinner for the night&#8230;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, one of the highlights of my life in terms of sports.  It just barely beats out beating my brother 84 times in a row in our drive way pick up games growing up.  (My specialty shot was the &#8220;I&#8217;m shooting this from NBA three, then running into the house as the ball&#8217;s in the air because I&#8217;m that sure it&#8217;s going in to win the game shot&#8221;)</p>
<p>The rest of the two weeks consisted of just lounging.  One day we rode our mopeds down to the tip of the island and rented kayaks and kayaked all around some smaller totally deserted islands.  The beaches weren&#8217;t great and we had no food and we (Jason) accidentally left our little friend Norman back on the mainland.  So all in all, it was just a massive back work out.</p>

<p>Jason and Jen learned how to cook authentic Thai food from our surrogate mothers on the island Joy and Nee.  They owned a shack of a restaurant a few hundred meters from our hut that we ended up eating curries, pad-thai, and other meals at a few times a day.  I want to adopt them and have them open up a Thai restaurant somewhere in the States.  Here&#8217;s Jason and Jen learning the ropes&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s rush-hour traffic on Koh Lanta.</p>
<p>In the end we ended up staying on Koh Lanta for 15 days or so.  We would meet a lot of people who were just traveling through and were amazed that we were staying in one place for 15 days, but that&#8217;s how much we loved it.  There wasn&#8217;t anything there not to love.  The people were unbelievably friendly, the food was amazing, the beaches were average but the water very warm and calm.  The fishing was excellent.  (I ended up catching 6 fish, all Jack&#8217;s&#8212;2 keepers)  No traffic, no McDonalds, no big resorts.  Koh Lanta is changing by the day, construction crews dot the island with noticeable progress being made on a daily basis.  The Koh Lanta I return to one day will not be the Koh Lanta I experienced in the winter of 2009.  That said, who cares.</p>
<p>I will never forget the times we had sitting on the beach, drinking beer, eating fresh fish minced with garlic that we cooked over our open fire.  We met people from all over the world, traveling to different places, we exchanged stories, jokes, friendly insults.  It took a 6 hour plane ride, a 15 hour bus ride, and a 3 hour ferry ride&#8212;sometimes the best places aren&#8217;t the closest or easiest places to get to, if they were, every one would go there.  Suddenly while sitting around that fire, enjoying life to the maximum, we understood why we put up with the bullshit of Korea sometimes, for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you see the Southern Cross for the first time, you&#8217;ll understand why you came this way.&#8221;  Well, when you see the peacefulness that is Koh Lanta, you too will know why you came all that way.  May you all get to experience Thailand one day, one of the most remarkable places on God&#8217;s green and sandy earth.</p>
