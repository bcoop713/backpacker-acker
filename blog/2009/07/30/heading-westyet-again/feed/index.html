		<description><![CDATA[I like the tid-bit about Mongolia. I&#039;m not ashamed to admit, I thought it was still a territory of China.  Sounds like an awesome travel plan with a lot of history, transposed into the present (Trans-Siberian Railroad especially).  Man, I wish I could be there...
Let us know when you might be touching down in NYC, and maybe we can meet up with you there.
If not, we--along with warm beaches, city bike rides and cold beer--await you in Chicago, my friend.

Enlightening Travels,
