                    <div class="storycontent">
                        <p>I&#8217;ve been on the road for 5 months now and am finally really &#8216;traveling.&#8217;  It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve done any (almost 8 months since I was in Southern Mexico and a full year from my Cuba/Dominican Republic trip.)  I&#8217;m on my 5th day in Thailand and already I feel as though I have been here for weeks, if not months.  The days go by excruitatingly slow and I couldn&#8217;t be any happier.  I feel as though the past 5 months in Korea have been justified and this is my reward.</p>
<p>The flight from Busan to Bangkok was only 5 hours but it feels like it should have been 16.  Thailand feels a world away from Korea.  The food is distinctly different (read: better)  and the people have a genuine friendliness to them.  They seem very content with their lives and very happy to be alive.  I have only been in the country for 5 days so I will report back after my full month here.  I have reached the point of traveling where I wake up every morning and have to sit up and think, ok what day is it?  I then debate with myself what day it is and around what date it is&#8230;(I&#8217;m usually within 3-4 days correct) That&#8217;s totally perfect and I know it means I&#8217;ve really let my mind go. (or is it the beers?)  Maybe it&#8217;s the countless Budhist temples I wander into every day, or the passing Monks who love to have a small chat, but my mind is quite at peace right now and there&#8217;s no better feeling in the world than that.  Here are a few temples, the pictures won&#8217;t load properly here in Thailand so until now you&#8217;ll have to click a few links to see them&#8230;Also since I was traveling alone there aren&#8217;t any shots of me, those will come next week, sorry folks&#8230;<br />

<p>The flight to Bangkok was delayed about an hour so I had a good chance to admire the Busan airport, all 7 gates in their full glory.  There was a man/woman dressed in a large Christmas Tree walking around for some reason and that kept me mildy entertained while I waited for the plane to be ready.  In Busan, for the larger planes, you get on a bus that drives you to the plane and you board that way.  The plane was huge but only filled maybe 25% to capacity.  I had my own row and had ample time to practice my meditation when the apparent China pollution rattled our plane like a jackhammer.  Nonethelss, I arrived safely, thanked my pilot, and headed into the crazy city of Bangkok.  I grabbed a taxi, who was very friendly and laughed at all the things I said, even if I&#8217;m not sure he knew what they meant.  He thought I was hilarious and immediately I thought to myself, I love this country already.</p>
<p>After getting lost for a little while, I finally found my step-dad&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s house in Bangkok.  He has a beautiful beautiful 3 story house and they gave me my own guestroom for the night.  In the morning, everyone had left to work and their maid, who was very kind, called a taxi for me as I needed to get to Chiang Mai for my supposed &#8216;hill trek.&#8217;  Well I took a taxi to the train station but every train was sold out except for the 10pm one which would put me into Chiang Mai at noon, way too late for my trek.  It might have been a blessing.  After doing some more research, I&#8217;ve read quite terrible things about the exploitation of the hill tribes by the commerical tourism and decided against it.  On my much larger trip next fall, I plan on exploring most of Laos and doing a hill trek there to visit a tribe where the government supposedly only grants very few permits and allows very few tourists.  </p>
<p>The overnight train was like most every other overnight train I&#8217;ve taken except for the fact that at first it doesn&#8217;t look like there are any beds on this train.  Sitting there across from my &#8216;bunk-mate&#8217; I looked around thinking to myself, &#8220;damnit, I swear I asked for a sleeper car.&#8221;  Then out of nowhere, big Thai men come and point at you and say &#8220;sleep now&#8221; and boom, a giant circus of a show goes on complete with beds folding down out of the ceiling, and benches being transformed into beds.  5 minutes later, I&#8217;m in my bed falling asleep to the trains rocking motion like a little baby.</p>
<p>The train pulled into Chiang Mai at around 11am and as we got off the train, I was more than happy to see a familiar sight, Backpackers!  Living in Busan, I haven&#8217;t met ANY travelers, and if on the off-chance I did meet a few, I think the conversation would go something like this:</p>
<p>Me:  Wow you guys are the first backpackers I&#8217;ve ever seen in Busan!<br />
Traveler 1:  WHAT? What is Busan?  Our travel guide told us he booked us to Tokyo!<br />
Me:  Yeah, that sucks, you&#8217;re in South Korea buddy.<br />
Traveler:  Noooooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_28811" class="attachmentlink">img_28811</a></p>
<p>Anyway, the last five days in Chiang Mai have been very relaxing.  This is a big city but it doesn&#8217;t feel that big.  I walk around the old city each day getting lost, taking pictures, finding my hostel, only to get lost 20 minutes later.  The people are so friendly and accomodating.  The food is great here as well.  Two dollars will get you a large plate of anything.  I have eaten like a king.  The people up there are genuinely friendly, even in such a large city and it is a pleasant change from Bangkok.</p>
<p>All the temples require you to remove your shoes before entering but I found it funny that when I walked into my first temple, there was one of the ugliest stray dogs in the temple &#8220;meditating.&#8221;  I guess flea-infested dogs can come in and find inner peace, but don&#8217;t you dare wear your shoes in.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_29001" class="attachmentlink">img_29001</a></p>
<p>I take tuk tuks everywhere, which are essentially motorcycles with a bench on the back and two wheels in the back.  They are quite cheap and some of the drivers are insane!  It&#8217;s fun thinking what he will do next and then he does the complete opposite, some have been too high that I&#8217;ve waved them along and flagged others.  Last thing I want is a high tuk tuk driver, that would equal disaster.  The first tuktuk I had in Chiang Mai, he had his little puppy in the front in a box along for the ride, so I thought, if he at least doesn&#8217;t care about my safety, surely he&#8217;ll drive more carefully because of the little guy&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_28831" class="attachmentlink">img_28831</a></p>
<p>The highlight of the week was undoubtely last night when at 4:45 in the morning, a GIANT explosion occured right outside my window.  Sparks flew everywhere and I&#8217;m ashamed to say I hit the deck of my guestroom immediately.  Now people, we all know BPA is tough, but this was not a small firecracker.  This was a genuine explosion that made the room and windows shake violently.  I hit the deck and did my best Army crawl towards the window to see if I could see a deranged Thai lobbing gernades at my window.  I don&#8217;t know if it was the 7% alcohol beer I drank before I went to bed, but for about 10 seconds I genuinely believed I might die in that Thai guesthouse and was in complete &#8216;survival&#8217; mode.  Funny now, not funny then.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, I&#8217;m staying in the Khao San area, some of you who have been here know this is where all the backpackers stay and it&#8217;s quite cheap.  The first night I stayed at a place that was realllly cheap but I paid dearly.  The cell&#8212;I mean room was located just on top of the kitchen and I smelled fried food the entire night, I think the cockroaches in the room were actually fatter than the ones in the other rooms as they were always smelling food and especially hungry.  I bounced out of there in a hurry in the morning and found a different place, for 12 bucks, it even has a pool.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, I&#8217;ve been visiting more temples, getting lost, laying at the pool and eating 70 cent plates of Thai food.  Amazing stuff.  Met a real nice man the other day who helped me find the skytrain after I got lost down some back streets.  It turns out he was from Chiang Mai, born and raised, and could speak English decently well.  We talked for 15 minutes and I was really ready for him to offer me something (which is a common theme here) in the way of a tour, drugs, massages, whatever, but at the end of the conversation he simply said &#8220;It was nice to meet you my friend&#8221; and walked away with a smile and a handshake.  I felt bad for thinking he wanted something out of the chat but in Bangkok, it happens everywhere you go and gets quite annoying.  Bottom line: Chiang Maiians sp.?  are some of the most friendly people I&#8217;ve encountered, up there with Australians, Kiwis, Cubans, and everyone from Latin America.</p>
<p>Today, I laid out at the pool and even went for a dip.  The crowd up there was very global and very friendly.  I made small talk with a German woman there with her family and her little son who was 4 and swimming around the pool with floaties naked.  A German nirvana CD cover if you will.   At one point I looked over at the kid, gave him a Hello and a smile to which he looked back with a face of shall I say &#8220;contentment.&#8221;  Now I was once a kid, and I have swam and subsequently been in the ocean and had to go the bathroom and I knew that face!  Out of the pool I went in a hurry and down to my room to shower.  A wise choice I think, that little devil. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m heading to the airport in a bit to get Jen and we&#8217;ll stay here for another few days then get the Tuesday morning train to the border of Thailand and Cambodia.  From there we will walk across the border, clear immigration and get a 3 hour share-taxi ride to Siem Reap.  We&#8217;ll stay there for 4-5 days and visit the temples and do all things Cambodian.  Back to Bangkok after that and a bus to Phuket where 15 days of island hopping will start&#8230;</p>
