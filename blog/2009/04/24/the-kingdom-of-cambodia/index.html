                    <div class="storycontent">
                        <p>The trip&#8212;scratch that, let&#8217;s call it a trek to Cambodia is quite the adventure.  Shaking our hang-over from the previous night on Khao San road, we grabbed a taxi to the Eastern Bangkok bus station.  With help from our smooth driving cabbie, we arrived just in time to board our bus and start the 5 hour journey to the border of Cambodia.</p>
<p>After a rather uneventful bus ride, we were let off at the bus station in a town called Aranya Prathet.  Not much can be said about this town because frankly, there&#8217;s nothing in the town worth talking about.  A Thai Toledo if you will.  From the bus station in Aranya Prathet, we negotiated a &#8220;fair&#8221; price with a Tuk-Tuk, a improvised motorcycle with a bench on the back.  After telling the driver four times &#8220;Border, border, border,&#8221; we were off.</p>
<p>5 minutes later we pull up to a shack of a house when the tuk-tuk driver honks his horn and out comes a ratty looking Thai guy with some sort of &#8220;credential&#8221; if you could call it that, barely clinging to his blue jean shirt, of which was missing a few buttons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Welcome to Cambodia.&#8221;  says the blue jeaned shirt fellow</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t Cambodia!&#8221; I reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is not Cambodia, this is the Cambodian Embassy, here are the papers you will need to fill out along with the fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>I look this shady fellow up and down and quickly decide this is a scam and in a raised voice I demand we go to the real border.  Sure enough, 5 minutes later we pull up to a decent sized white building that reads Cambodian Embassy of Thailand and we head in, pay for our 15 day visas and get back in our corrupt Tuk-Tuk as he takes us as close to the border as he can before stopping the Tuk-Tuk and letting us out.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge, the closer one gets to a border, the rougher, poorer, and desperate people are.   The Cambodian border with Thailand is no exception to the rule.  If you don&#8217;t believe this is true, take a trip to Tijuana or any border sites along Texas.  Hell, walk down to Windsor, Ontario, you&#8217;ll be sure to see some dishelved, hungover 19 year old American frat boy who lost his passport begging Border Patrol to let him back in.  That&#8217;s life, people who have to go to a different country to sell goods or work on a daily basis generally don&#8217;t have a lot of disposable income.  When&#8217;s the last time you heard an orthopedic surgeon say, &#8220;Headin to the Tijuana barrios to do some scopes, be back tonight.&#8221;  (Unless they were with Doctors With Out Borders or he&#8217;s running drugs)</p>
<p>The border is indescribalble through a website (I need not remind you this is a website, not a blog)  The smells and the heat eminating from this kilometer stretch of land is something only few travelers get to experience.  There were no tour groups here, just a few backpackers.  As we sat in the steamy customs office waiting for our visa, 12 men pushing carts stacked 15 feet high of goods would struggle at a snail&#8217;s pace to advance their goods towards the &#8220;riches&#8221; of Thailand.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3028.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3028.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3028.jpg" alt="img_3028.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3031.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3031.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3031.jpg" alt="img_3031.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>Coming from Thailand, Cambodia seems a different world.  It struck me as the type of place where you don&#8217;t fear the thugs of Cambodia, you fear the police of Cambodia.  In my short 5 days in Mexico City, I heard numerous stories of travelers that led me to believe that police officers were the ones who could most hurt you, both physically and financially.  When backpacking, I&#8217;d almost rather take a few to the face then a few to the wallet, chicks dig scars, and I have my share. (of scars, not chicks) *****Side note- I taught my students the phrase &#8220;chicks dig scars&#8221; but being Korean and obsessed with their looks, found it incomprehensible.</p>
<p>After making it through the border, we were now in the awful town of Poipet, Cambodia.  It resembled something from a war zone that some half-assed government tried to make look presentable, but it more resembled a hideously ugly chick who just piles on the makeup to the point where  she had been better off just going &#8220;natural.&#8221;  The entire town is just filled with early 90&#8217;s Toyota Camrys, some have license plates, most don&#8217;t.  We were taken a kilometer away from the border where we waited for a &#8220;cousin&#8221; of one of the hustlers.  He insisted it was a &#8220;good legal car&#8221; that would take us to our intended destination of Siem Reap, home of mighty Angkor Wat.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3034.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3034.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3034.jpg" alt="img_3034.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>our path to Siem Reap</p>
<p>The drive took around 4 hours, with a stop at the two hour mark at a local shack to buy ice cold sodas for 25 cents and whatever fruits your heart desired.  At the shack were three other Toyota&#8217;s all packed with fellow backpackers making the journey to Siem Reap.  After four hours in the Camry with two French nationals who were doctors who had just finished their stint in Africa, we arrived to the town of Siem Reap and were immediately transfered to a waiting tuk-tuk.  Why the driver couldn&#8217;t drive the 3 km more into town, we couldn&#8217;t figure out.  Then again, part of us didn&#8217;t want to know the reason.  Some things are better left unknown.</p>
<p>We ended up finding an extrememly cheap and friendly hostel appropriately enough named &#8220;Smiley Guesthouse.&#8221;  We had a good sized room with a balcony that overlooked magnificent orange glowing sunsets every night.  In the mornings, we&#8217;d head down to the kitchen where we&#8217;d relax in hand-woven straw chairs and eat eggs and fresh bread and fruit.  The rate for the room at Smiley Guesthouse was $6 a night.  After staying there for 5 nights and eating 5 breakfasts, our grand total for the 5 night stay was a whopping 50 dollars between the two of us for 5 nights and breakfast each morning.  Yeah I could live in a place dropping 25 a week.  That&#8217;d do just fine.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3181.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3181.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3181.jpg" alt="img_3181.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>me on my balcony enjoyin the &#8216;good life&#8217;</p>
<p>Let me explain Siem Reap.  The only reason people venture to Siem Reap is because of Angkor Wat, the ancient Cambodian temples that loom ominous over the hordes of tourists walking among them.  The town has no paved roads, only dirt streets which makes dust more prevalent than air.</p>
<p>*Sidenote:  We had met three Koreans at a bus stop in Arranya Prathet, Thailand on the way to Siem Reap.  We had a brief conversation and at the end, he bent down and offered us 2 dust masks.  Koreans love their dust masks so we thought it was quite funny that they were offering to people in random areas in Thailand, where the air was especially pure and clean.  Two days later while walking through Siem Reap for the first time, we frantically searching for said dusk masks only to realize they were left in the guesthouse.  To those Koreans we say Thank you anyway, and we are sorry for underestimating your global knowledge.</p>
<p>So what do we, seasoned travelers,  do after realizing we are in the dustiest place on earth?  We decide it&#8217;d be an excellent idea to rent bicycles and CYCLE into Angkor Wat and the temples.  From the guesthouse, the  ride was a 10km jaunt into the temple zone.  10km sounds like nothing, but in 93 degree heat, riding two 1980&#8217;s era Schwinns with tires that refused to hold air, with a seat built for somebody with a steel ass, it was a painful, yet rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Once inside the temple zone, every turn we made on the bicycle revealed another towering temple, most of them had faces carved into the pillars, almost as if the Cambodian gods were looking at us wonder&#8230;&#8221;why the hell those fools riding bikes around my temples?&#8221;  We were thinking the same thing about an hour into the ride when our asses went numb. I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t help the situation by imitating the little Asian kid from Indiana Jones everytime we walked into a new temple&#8230;&#8221;Indy, you go now! Indy! Indy!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3066.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3066.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3066.jpg" alt="img_3066.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3080.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3080.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3080.jpg" alt="img_3080.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3236.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics189]" title="img_3236.jpg"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/img_3236.jpg" alt="img_3236.jpg" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="270" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>The circuit we decided on was 25km around and it took us through numerous temples all around the National Park.  There were stretches where we wouldn&#8217;t see another person or car, just rice fields and dense rainforest.  We saw monkeys, water buffalo, it was Jen&#8217;s first encounter with monkeys, though she does live with me, so she had some idea what it&#8217;d be like to meet and mingle with them&#8230;</p>
<p>Cambodia is different from the fact that there are a ton of beggars in Cambodia.  I&#8217;ve been through my countries and have seen beggars, but anytime you enter a country where begging is prevalent, it always makes for difficult and sometimes awkward situations where you don&#8217;t know the true motivation behind the people you are meeting.  An example&#8230;</p>
<p>We pulled off our bikes to watch a local man playing and feeding monkeys off of his run down motorcycle, he spoke with us a tiny bit and offered us some nuts to feed to the monkeys.  Jen accepted and I pulled out a few dollars to give to the man for the small amount of nuts and the picture opporunity.  After five minutes it was clear to me that this man wanted no part of my donation, he just wanted to talk and was just a very genuinely friendly person.  These can sometimes make for difficult situations&#8212;a few k&#8217;s down the road, I stopped to take a few photos of some children walking along a rice field, those kids were wise to the game and demanded a few coins for their time.  I happily obliged.  So in the span of a kilometer, we experienced two ends of the spectrum regarding hand-outs.</p>
<p>After visiting some more temples (a reminder all photos can be found on the photo section page of the website) we made the turn for home.  On the way back, I got into a few cycling races with some 7 year old Cambodian kids who were riding bicycles 5 times the size of them.  The cycles were so large, they couldn&#8217;t sit on the seat, but had to ride standing.  I&#8217;m quite sure I lost every race, I wanted to know how to say in Cambodian &#8220;My ass hurts, my face is sunburned, but if I see you out here tomorrow you little punk, you&#8217;re going down.&#8221;  Instead my Cambodian was limited to &#8220;Thanks&#8221; as I rode on the dusty road towards home.</p>
<p>On the ride back, we stopped to see why a crowd of people had gathered on a dusty side road.  There was a men&#8217;s volleyball game going on, complete with extreme gambling on the outcome of the match.  The men weren&#8217;t wearing shoes and had only ripped blue jean shorts on but the crowd treated it as a championship match.  I desperately wanted to go place a few bets, have a few beers with the locals, but thought better of it when I realized Jen was now the only female in the crowd of over 200, with blonde hair to boot.</p>
<p>The following morning we stumbled out of bed, slightly hungover, to go see the sunrise at Angkor Wat.  We waited for 20 minutes for our taxi, which we arranged the previous night, but in typical Cambodian fashion, he never showed.  The sky at Angkor Wat is &#8220;supposed&#8221; (notice the quotation marks) to turn bright red in the morning which provides for stunning pictures.  Well, the sky only turn bright red in the summer apparently, and in the winter, it&#8217;s a slight pink.  It was beautiful nonetheless, just not what we expected.  There were also a few hundred other people there so it was quite the ordeal to try and get a good photo with out some dope in the background posing with the resident Angkor donkey.</p>
<p>We toured a few more temples, headed back into town where we filled up on the best Indian Curry I&#8217;ve ever had, all for a few dollars.  We ended up going to the same restaurant almost every night and I briefly looked into the penalties for smuggling a Indian man from Siem Reap into Korea to work as my personal chef.  (Korea is kind of against that it turns out, go figure)</p>
<p>The next morning we were back in a 93 Camry headed towards the Thai border.  Although we only had 6 days in Cambodia, it has firmly planted itself on the list of countries I will definitely be back to.  The people were very warm and friendly, despite the extreme poverty and history of war.  Research the Khmer Rouge regime and you will find out that 1.5 million people died in a 4 year span when the Communist leaders gained control.  This was as late as 1978 people, this should shock you.  That being said, the country has moved on, I read a report in the New York Times last week that only 30% of people under 30 are aware of the Khmer Rouge regime.  Disturbingly sad.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay in Cambodia long enough to give it a rousing send-off in the last paragraph of this entry.  It wouldn&#8217;t be fair to the country or myself as I didn&#8217;t get a true grasp of the country.  I will tell you what I do know&#8212;The food is amazing, the Cambodian curries are some of the best I&#8217;ve had, every person we met, even in the face of poverty, was extremely kind and helpful.  If I am lucky, and determined enough, I will come up through the South of Cambodia on my next trip and experience the capital, Phnom Penh, and the Killing Fields.  Until then, I must bid farewell to yet another country on my journey that is life.  Cambodia, you were a good host, until we meet again, which I have a sneaking suspicion we will&#8230;</p>
<p>From the dusty motorcycle-filled roads of Siem Reap,</p>
