                    <div class="storycontent">
                        <p>And here I was, packing my rucksack yet again for a trip that hasn´t really been planned out, which isn´t new.  Ever since I´ve read che guevara´s motorcycle diaries, the panamerican highway has been calling.  I often found it strange when I would meet australians, israelis, and europeans who had traveled extensively through the americas and I had merely skirted through costa rica, (a great adventure in itself with my buddy ari, the first trip that gave me a taste of what was the road, and what is a life of traveling).  The fact that these fellow travelers, from far more distant lands than the USA, had traveled more than I had through the americas, when I lived in the united states of <em>america, </em>was unexceptable.</p>
<p>I too, like che guevara, believe the division of the americas to be a trivial and insignificant issue.  We are all Americans and this continent stretches from the northern tip of alaska to the southern tip of chile regardless of how countries have divided themselves with imaginary lines we tend to call borders.  I think it is every american´s duty to learn as much as possible about our neighbors.  Thus, this is my goal, to travel from the panama canal north to mexico city or at least southern mexico, meeting as many people as possible along the way and showing our fellow americans that the big bad neighbors to the north can speak a little spanish and do care a bit about their culture and life.</p>
<p>So i took off from denver, where I had spent the past 3 weeks, and landed in san jose, costa rica to meet jen and head south, then north again to mexico.  the plane ride was uneventful except for the flying through a thunderstorm the pilot said was ´too big to go over´   so at 39,000 feet, our airplane turned into a roller coaster for 10 minutes and i didnt think id make it out of the u.s., let alone to mexico.  alas, like always, i made it, and took taxi from the san jose airport to a city called heredia, just outside san jose.  i met jen there and we ended up staying in heredia for a few nights with her host family before buying a bus ticket to a small town on the caribbean coast called cahuita.</p>
<p>The next morning we grabbed a bus to Cahuita, feel free to look it up, a very relaxed caribbean town in costa rica.  The town had no stoplights and only dirt roads complete with tons of authentic rastas and a very distinct smell in the air.  On our way to our hostel in Cahuita, we were humpin down a dirt road when it started to pour, we heard a voice yell out &#8220;hey you, where you from?&#8221;  We stammered over and was invited to have a few beers with a couple from LA who were on their honeymoon.  In typical BPA fashion, instead of locking down our accommodations for the night, we figured  beers were in order and the planning of sleep quarters would come later.  The dude ended up playing football for Northwestern back in the day while the girl was a softball player there.  We exchanged some stories, drank a few beers and headed off to our lodgings.We landed a spot right across from the beach and the national park for 20 bucks a night and settled in for the next 5 days.  We took a hike in the national park, saw some monkeys, even saw one that was getting a bit friendly with a yellow snake that was on the tree which you can kind of see in this picture&#8230;</p>

<p>Jen also gave me a haircut and it is much cooler now, even though i insist my hair is falling out, jen insists otherwise, we made a bet that i´d be bald by 30 so even if I go bald, i´ve created a win&#8217;win situation for myself.  I`m one clever dude.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/dscf0887.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics244]" title="dscf0887.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/dscf0887.thumbnail.jpg" alt="dscf0887.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="300" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>About 5 days later, we caught a 2 hour bus to the border of Panama.  I`ve crossed a handful of borders in my day, but this was undoubtedly one of the shadiest.  First off, I could have just sauntered across the border with a kilo of cocaine on my head and I`m not 100 percent sure I would have been stopped.  We decided to go about it the legit away and had our papers in order as we headed across the world`s most delapidated bridge.  I also made Jen carry the kilo as I thought they suspect her less.  Giant holes in the bridge would end your life with one quick mis-step.  The bridge is used by giant multi-national banana companies and why they won`t fix it is beyond me.  I don`t have the energy or computer ability to lecture them.  (this computer totally sucks, and the space bar barely works, so you will all have to just deal with the gramatical errors and lack of captilization at some points).</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/dscf0901.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics244]" title="dscf0901.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/dscf0901.thumbnail.jpg" alt="dscf0901.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="300" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Anywho, we made it across the bridge, no easy task with a 50 lb backpack on your back and a small daypack on your front.  Naturally, the locals breezed across with the ease of one of those Chinese dudes at halftime of an NBA game walking on plates and teacups.  We grabbed a taxi to Almirante, a city in northern Panama where we knew we could get a water taxi to Bocas Del Toro.  Bocas Del Toro is a bunch of islands in Northern Panama that have beautiful beaches, some killer surf (all reef breaks of course) and some very friendly people, save for a few, which I´ll get to in a bit at the dismay of my mother.</p>
<p>The first night we stayed in Mondo Taitu which was a shotty place but had a good party atmosphere, which would have been great if that was what we were looking for.  We spent one night there and immediately moved to Gran Kahuna a hostel run by Rasta guys and we paid 12 bucks each for a dorm bed across from the ocean.  The atmosphere was great, the people were amazing.</p>
<p>Bocas Del Toro is a very laid back place with one main street and not much going on.  They have a few bars that get going at night but not much else.  In order to get to any of the beaches around the various islands you have to take a water taxi.   The water taxis are just small motorboats.  The second day on the island we went to Isla Caranero, it has a world famous break called Silverbacks there where it can get over 20 feet, so no way in hell I was going to try that.   I only surf breaks over 50 feet, didn´t you know this?</p>
<p>You can pretty much walk clear around Isla Caranero so that is what we did, finding secluded beaches along the way.  We also got to see our first sloth.  This thing reminds me of my brother and my buddy Noah at 5 a.m. on a Saturday.  It was moving so slow, I could have run around the island 9 times and it still would have been on the same branch.</p>
<p>The next day we took a bus to the very tip of the main island, roughly 15 km away.  We were headed to Starfish beach, a beach that had&#8230;lobsters.  It actually had starfish and seeing as how we had never seen one before we thought it´d be good to check out.  You know who also thought it´d be good to check out Starfish with us?  Bad luck.  Bad luck was with us from the start.  One would think that a 15km ride would only take 20 minutes but not a chance my friends, not a chance.  First off, we were scheduled to leave for the beach at 11 a.m. only instead of leaving for the beach, we circled around town with our driver´s assistant yelling &#8220;Playa Estrella&#8221; over and over until finally we had a full bus.</p>
<p>This was only the start.  Finally reaching cruising speeds of 60 km/hr, the bus swerved violently to the right and we thought we were heading to a watery death.  I glanced out the window and there was a 6 year old boy running clear into the path of our oncoming bus.  The front of the bus swerved and barely avoided him, but the back of the bus would have no such luck.  Boom Boom Pow.  The back wheel ran over the kids legs.  People on the bus screamed, and we threw it into reverse to check on the boy.  By some miracle (Bad luck was late on his rent check), the boy simply had bloody feet and not much else, though he was crying up a storm as you might expect.  He dented the side of the bus somehow with possibly his head and the driver of the bus was none too pleased about his new dent in his new bus.  They took the boy to the hospital and we finally made it to the beach.</p>
<p>After that experience we were glad to soak in the turquoise waters of Starfish beach with fish that couldn´t hurt us if we abused their mothers in front of them.  Ah Starfish, the Ned Flanders of the ocean.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/dscf0948.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics244]" title="dscf0948.JPG"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/dscf0948.thumbnail.jpg" alt="dscf0948.JPG" class="imageframe imgalignleft" height="300" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>The following day we decided to try our hand at surfing.  &#8220;Trying your hand, surfing, and Panama&#8221; are all words that should never be put in the same sentence.  That´s all I´ll say.  The waves were brutal, messy, choppy. We got our asses kicked.  The only highlights of the day were the boat ride to the deserted beach at which we passed over mountains of swells.  I´m talking 25 foot swells where our boat would go up for 6 seconds then down for 6 seconds, a snowmobile on the water if you will.</p>
<p>The second highlight came when I was exiting the water and saw four German girls who were set up next to us on the beach chasing their German friend (a guy).  At first, I thought this a fairly silly game as they were all running around like little school girls.  Though they were running very fast, I thought whatever game this must be, it is taken very seriously in Germany.  The German man ran my way and grabbed my arm stating in broken English, between deep breaths, &#8220;Men in bushes, rags over faces, machetes, run with us.&#8221;  Sold.  I needed nothing more, we ran to our stuff, gathered it, then ran quickly to the only other group on the beach and told them.</p>
<p>As it turned out, there had been four men in the jungle just off the beach with machetes and bandanas over their faces and dark sunglasses.  One man had moved very quietly and slowly towards the group.  The German man, let´s call him Gerhardt, noticed the man, stood up and yelled something to let him know he was spotted.  The other three men then charged from the rear of the jungle with machetes which caused the Germans to play their little game of chase each other and run like fools.  The 15 of us all gathered our stuff together and huddled like penguins, attempting to look bigger than we actually were.</p>
<p>Now I didn´t see anyone, but all the Germans most certainly did.  They were white in the face and could hardly breathe.  I´ve traveled a ton, and never have heard of anything like this happening.  We had heard small stories about not hiking from one deserted beach Red Frog to where we were, Wizards, but nothing to this extent.  It was definitely a wake up call that is sometimes needed when traveling.  Trust no one, be aware of your surroundings, and always carry a bigger machete then the others.  To my family-do not worry, this was an isolated incident and we found out from locals that they do that to get you to run away from your belongings which they then take.  Either way, makes for a good story.</p>
