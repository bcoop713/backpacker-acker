		<description><![CDATA[Very similar situation to Karen. I want to do some riding in Russia, and I would like to buy a bike in KZ or in Mongolia, really don&#039;t care in which country. What was the market like? How much did you buy your bike for? I was originally thinking a Japanese bike, for better handling and reliability on the Russia offroads, but now I don&#039;t know, I am also taking into account the availability of parts on the Russian bikes. How many bikes were at the market? How difficult was the registration and customs process? Thanks so much!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Karen,

You can find a bike there for anywhere from $500US to $6000US.  A lot of Chinese lower end motorcycle but also a lot of Hondas, which are more reliable and can be fixed easier in the countryside.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not sure if you are checking back in BUT, I am working in Kazakhstan right now and looking at buying a bike either in Kazakhstan (Ural) and riding into Mongolia in May/June or flying into Ulaanbaatar and buying a bike there.  Buying there I sell there and I don&#039;t care the make, buying here, I take it home with me.

What is the price range for buying at the Black Market?

Cheers!]]></description>
