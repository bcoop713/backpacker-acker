		<description><![CDATA[Jared,
Your mom sent me your blog and now you know how it feels to be on the other side of the desk,  ha ha.
Remember back in the old days when you tried to send me emails and I tried to answer them-now look what you can do. I loved the photos and you and your girlfriend look great.
Have a wonderful experience.
Always,
Sharon Schwartz]]></description>
