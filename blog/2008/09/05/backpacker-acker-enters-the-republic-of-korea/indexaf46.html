                        <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">Busan, South Korea&#8212;If you dont like being stared at, South Korea just simply isn&#8217;t the place for you.  I&#8217;ve been to a handful of countries the past five years and I&#8217;m quite used to being stared at, but South Koreans bring staring to a whole new level.  In New York City, or anyplace in the world for that matter, if you get caught staring at someone, usually you would look away quickly, as to not be rude.  Here?  No, they&#8217;ll just keep staring at you as if there is a giant pig doing the hula in a grass skirt directly behind your head that they are dying to see. I haven&#8217;t found out the way to combat this staring &#8220;showdown,&#8221; but I&#8217;ve got a few ideas. 1) Paint mean-looking eyeballs on my eyelids so when I catch them staring I&#8217;ll just shut my eyes&#8212;BAM, it might freak them out no?2) Stare back and engage in a staring contest of a lifetime (these dudes have a lock-down on the world&#8217;s best starers (is that a word?)</span></p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">I am teaching 4th, 5th, and 6th grades, while Jen is teaching 7th, 8th and 9th grades.  We will report more on the actual kids later. After walking the 20 minutes to my school from my dong,  (that just sounds wrong)  I walked into the courtyard of the school only to be swamped by school children saying &#8220;hi&#8221; &#8220;nice to meet you&#8221; and &#8220;david beckham!!!&#8221;  (my head is shaved now)Jen and I simply cannot go anywhere with out someone attempting to speak english to us, or coming over to say hello.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">The cab driver who took us back to our dong from the market was overly-excited to get me in the front seat of the taxi while Jen stayed in the back.  I thought he was just friendly at first, but little did I know he had ulterior motives.  Turns out he was a afficionado of people with blonde hair on their arms.  Lucky me, my blonde arm hair was now one foot from his reach and he had no qualms about reaching over, rubbing and playing with my arm-hair while he drove.  </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">Jen thought it was hilarious as he spoke no english whatsoever and was now asking to see my chest-hair.  I obliged and showed him my chest, he was less-than impressed, I guess I wasn&#8217;t nearly as hairy as he had hoped.  Oh well!  I was just happy he stopped asking to see my body hair at my chest. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">I was told by my co-teacher that I would attend a ceremony with all 1200 of the children in the school.  It was being held in the courtyard overlooking a giant valley, filled with high-rising apartments and those ominous green mountains in the background.  Quite a setting.  The ceremony started and the principal (whom I had met earlier and speaks zero english, a common theme) marched out.  When I say marched, I mean marched.  Apparently, my principal was in the Army back in his heyday.  Well, he still thinks he is in the Army, because he had these kids marching in beat, standing at attention, then at-ease, then bowing on command.  My co-teacher told me that before he arrived at the school, it wasn&#8217;t nearly as strict, the children would stand where they wanted.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">These children were lined up 20 deep in symetrical lines according to height.  It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.  Now, according to my co-teacher, also my translator, he was about to introduce the new teachers.  The first three Korean teachers were announced to minor applause, and then it was my turn.  Now don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m tootin my own horn here, but the applause I got was something out of an NSync (are they still alive?) concert.  The girls were screaming in a high-pitched tone and the boys were yelling and applauding.  I wanted to grab the microphone and scream out &#8220;Thank you Busan!&#8221; but I held back. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">The General, I mean the principal decided I should say a few words and the co-teacher told me to head to the podium that was elevated thirty feet off the ground in front of the student body.  They applauded as I came to the podium and I think I began to faint.  The grey sky turned black and I got light-headed.  I was standing in front of 1300 people in the middle of a mountainous valley, thousands of miles from my home and being asked to speak.  If I had a camera, this picture would be up on my wall, framed, until the day I die. I gripped the podium so hard I swear I thought I might destroy it.  I was afraid I was going to faint and fall over and have to be carried off the stage by 8 little Korean children.  It would have made for a great story at least.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal">I started my speech with the obvious &#8220;Hello, my name is Jared Acker&#8221; which brought more applause.  The whole thing was compounded by the fact that when I said my first sentence, the echo over the giant speakers carried my voice clear across the valley, and I was now listening to myself speak 3 seconds after I said what I wanted to say into the microphone. I&#8217;m no public speaker, but I think I held my own once I got used to hearing my own voice and the delay.  I commented on how happy I was to be there, and ended it with &#8220;Kimsa-nida&#8221;  thank you in Korean, which brought the house down and sent chills through my body.  When you travel, there are moments you never forget, this was one.  In twenty years, wherever in the world I am, I will be able to sit back, pound a beer, and tell people the story of the day I gave a speech in front of 1200 in a valley on the Southern tip of the</span><br />
