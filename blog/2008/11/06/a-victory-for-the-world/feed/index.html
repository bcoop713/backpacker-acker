		<description><![CDATA[What an AMAZING post. Thank you for this beautiful piece of writing. I know you must have been yearning to be here on November 4, 2008, but don&#039;t fret. You are providing a service not all of us can afford to do in this point in time, being a soldier for social justice and love. While the international community rejoices in this idea of &quot;Barack Obama,&quot; you are bringing it to fruition for them, in the flesh! Keep up the good work Backpacker Acker! We miss you. Much love and peace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was at the rally, it was pretty amazing.  Certainly the defining political moment of my generation.  It was the most incredible thing I&#039;ve ever seen really.  The most diverse, most enthusiastic crowd I&#039;ve ever witnessed at a political event, it had the energy of a rock show.  Older people, young people, people of every nationality, every immigrant community.  Muslim women with head scarfs.  Hockey moms.  When they announced the winner, untold amounts of people were crying.  When it spilled out into the loop, it was the wildest celebration I&#039;ve ever seen.  A sea of people, shoulder to shoulder, clogging Michigan Avenue from Roosevelt to Wacker, screaming, hugging, yelling, African cab drivers laying on the horn at every corner with a fist raised out the window screaming &quot;Obama!&quot;  Biking home at 1am, it may as well have been 8:30am on a workday, the bike traffic so thick along the main cycling thoroughfares that every red light caught throngs of young people in Obama t-shirts just long enough to high-five and congratulate each other, perfect strangers hatching plans of where to go to celebrate.  I wound up at Sedgewicks, then Kingston Mines.  All those vagaries of hope and change seemed tangible, and I really think he is inspiring a new generation of political participation.  I&#039;m pretty pumped.

		<description><![CDATA[Very eloquently written, my friend (catch the McCainism?, gawd, I hate that phrase!)  Nice to hear some experiences from outside the U.S. BTW, I was at the rally, and it was one of the best experiences of my life (no, not trying to make you homesick), but I still think the best word for it all, after everything was said and done, was shell-shocked.  Like after a war is done...]]></description>
