		<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I loved your Mongolian Motorcycle Trip Part 1... but where is part 2? Did everything work out? Was there a disaster? Did you sell excusive rights to the magazine and so can&#039;t publish it here?

My wife and I are doing the same thing - we&#039;ve just spent 5 months travelling through South East Asia (3 months on purchased 125cc scooters). We&#039;re on the verge of buying out bikes in Mongolia now. It&#039;s great to read about other people doing similar things and hearing of their exploits... and more importantly validating that either (a) we&#039;re not crazy to be attempting it, or (b) we are crazy but at least we won&#039;t be alone in the asylum.

I look forward to reading more at some point. 

By the way, how did you manage to get a magazine on-board? Did they just randomly find your blog or did you do some legwork?

Cheers,
Nigel]]></description>
