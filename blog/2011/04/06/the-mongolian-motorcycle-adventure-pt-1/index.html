                    <div class="storycontent">
                        <p>There are times in life when things start to feel stagnant.  The  extremity of the feeling varies person by person but there is little  doubt that every person who has walked this beautiful earth has felt  that helpless feeling.  Helpless no more we decided.  After a year in  ultra-conservative, think-in-the-box South Korea, we needed a trip that  would test our limits, justify why the hell I had picked up and moved  from a happening city where I could drink beautiful, rich beers in tiny  corner pubs to a place where the local &#8220;Hite&#8221; tasted more like formaldehyde  than anything resembling a brew.  After careful  consideration (internet travel message boards after a few glasses of  whiskey) we decided Chinggis Khan&#8217;s kingdom was beckoning.  We would  head over to China and catch a northbound train to Mongolia.  We knew  little about Mongolia, we knew even less about motorcycles.  It was  settled, we would ride motorcycles across Mongolia.</p>
<div id="attachment_279" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-279 " title="Planning" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/Picture-012-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.backpackeracker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Picture-012-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.backpackeracker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Picture-012.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Planning for a trip usually (always) involves beer, a computer, a guidebook, the occasional credit card, and more beer.</p></div>
<p>For the last 2  months of my contract in Korea, I passed away the days by teaching,  working out, then doing as much research as I could about Mongolia and  how we best could pull this trip off.  I still think it was fair to  assign my 5th grade E.S.L. class a project on miles per gallon for  motorcycles and Mongolian infrastructure.  If only Joon-Kim would have  stopped asking me why we were studying backroads of Mongolia.  &#8220;But Mr.  Acker I don&#8217;t even have a motorcycle, and what is Mongolia?&#8221; isn&#8217;t an  acceptable answer to &#8220;Where is the best place to fill-up your motorcycle  between Ulan Batur and Erdenet.  I hope that kid got his stuff  together.</p>
<p>What we found out was probably as much as you currently know.  It&#8217;s a  country somewhere between China and Russia.  It has a ton of open space  and not very many people.  Most recommendations about motorcycling from  people who traveled there went something like this&#8212;&#8220;I saw someone  doing it, he looked pretty sad&#8221; or &#8220;Are you going for a BMW-R1200?&#8221;   (that bike costs upwards of $16,000).  We finally concluded that we  would arrive to the capital and buy two Chinese models.  Buying a  Chinese bike over a Russian bike is apparently the equivalent of buying a  Pontiac Sunbird over a Saab.  But as those of us who have owned a  Sunbird before can attest, they are a hell of a lot cheaper.  By the  way, if anyone has seen that car, (I lost it in a bet to a guy named Phillip and a three-legged dog), give her a hug for me and whatever you do,  under no circumstance should you try and drive it with out your seatbelt on.  You&#8217;ve been warned.</p>
<p>Preparing for the trip in our South Korean studio apartments proved  to be a challenge.  We had shit strewn around like a garage sale in the  ghetto.  This was organized chaos with out the organized part.  We  didn&#8217;t want to take much gear so it mainly consisted of really cheap,  really useless stuff we found in Chinese markets.  For example, a small  Chinese-made flashlight equipped with a red laser beam.  I&#8217;d like to say  I bought this because it was a flashlight when in fact I bought it  because it had a laser beam.</p>

Yeah that&#39;s all I have to say about the train, afterall, it&#39;s a frickin&#39; train.</p></div>
<p>The train ride to Seoul was uneventful.  We just wanted to be in  Mongolia already.  We caught a 36 hour ferry ride to Tanjin, China from  Seoul.  The ferry had the feel of the Titanic and we were definitely  sleeping where Jack slept.  4 of us jammed into a corner of a back room  that smelled like fish and poo.  It was the most glorious 36 hours of my  life.  Regardless we made it to Tanjin and then because of a lack of  busses, had to take a taxi to the train station to catch a train to  Beijing.</p>

<p>The taxi driver spoke no English and wrote down his fare request on a  napkin on our way to the Tanjin train station, a roughly 45 minute  ride.  Seeing as how we had never been to China before and we failed in  our preliminary research to find out the exchange rate for the Yuan, we  had no idea if the smelly driver was requesting the equivalent of $50 or  $500.  Not caring for our predicament, the driver sped on to Tanjin and  we knew we had to figure out how much he was requesting before arrival  to a dark alley in Tanjin where Mr. Wong, the only person who lifts  weights in China would strongly recommend we pay the agreed upon fare.<br />
I yelled for the driver to stop at the equivalent of an American  Wal-Mart and told the cabbie to keep the meter running while I booked it  inside the store.  I needed to find something priced universally where I  could quickly calculate the exchange rate.  Beer.  I can rattle off the  top beers in 43 different countries so I was quickly directed to the  beer isle where I learned the cabbie was indeed charging us a very  reasonable rate.  An hour later we were waiting for our bullet train to  Beijing in the Tanjin airport, a cold six pack of Tsingtao in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_286" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/Picture-118.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-286" title="leaving" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/Picture-118-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.backpackeracker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Picture-118-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.backpackeracker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Picture-118.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wish I had left the hairdo in China.  Heading North to Mongolia, the adventure is about to begin.</p></div>
<p>We stayed in Beijing for a few days.  It was my second trip to  Beijing in as many months so we didn&#8217;t do much exploring.  We soaked in  our last bit of modern civilization (food courts, movies in the hostel,  e-mail) and woke up real early one morning and humped it a mile over to  the Beijing Central Train Station.  We had booked our tickets in advance  (strongly recommended) and headed down towards the cement platforms to  find our train.  Finding the train would not be a problem.  You mean we  weren&#8217;t going to be taking this super shiny silver train that looks like  a spaceship to Mongolia?  Our train looked like a real version of a  model train a 7 year old kid would get from his grandfather for  Christmas.</p>

<p>We spent the next 36 hours en route to Mongolia in a small cabin car  with two old guys from Mallorca, Spain.  They didn&#8217;t speak any English  so I became David Holt&#8217;s personal translator.  The northern part of  China we saw was very industrial.  It was easy to see how almost 1.5  billion people live in that country.  The &#8220;small&#8221; cities looked like 3  Detroits all lined up next to each other.</p>
<p>At the Chinese-Mongolian border, the train stops and you have two  choices, stay on the train while they change the wheels (they use a  different size track in Mongolia) or get off and wait at the customs  &#8220;station.&#8221;  We opted for the former (how often do you get to see a train  change its wheels?) and then were forced into the latter when we were  sitting on a stoop outside of the customs station having a drink and our  train pulled away.  I&#8217;d like to tell you all I knew the train was just  going down the tracks a mile or so to a waiting garage to change out the  wheels but that&#8217;d be a lie.  10-12 seconds of panic led me to believe I  was being deserted and would spend the next 3-4 years of my life in the  customs station on the Mongolian-Chinese border.</p>

<p>We pulled into the Ulan Batur train station and were more than happy  to get the hell out of our now-stinky, dirty 6 x 6 cabin car we spent  40 hours in with two hairy old guys.  We stepped out and a young woman  approached us speaking pretty decent English telling us about a place we  could sleep.  We weren&#8217;t really sure what she meant but at this point  we had no options so we did what any stranger in a strange land would  do&#8212;got in a strange car with her and another really big Mongolian guy  and off we went.  They dropped us off down a dirt alley and a giant  steel door slid open.  Behind it was the man who would single-handedly  make our adventure possible, Papa Mongolia.</p>

<p>Behind the massive steel door that could have been bigger than the  one at the U.S. Embassy was a short, 50-something, pot-bellied,  Mongolian man with grayish-black hair and a firm handshake.  He  immediately tried to sell us the most expensive room in the &#8220;hostel&#8221; for  a whopping 25 dollars a  night.  I use quotation marks with hostel  because it was more his house that had a few spare bedrooms that he may  or may have not built himself.  In the middle of his driveway, he had a  giant ger tent that also had beds.  We decided to compromise between the  two and settled for a semi-private room for 15 bucks.</p>
<div id="attachment_292" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/Picture-186.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-292" title="Picture 186" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/Picture-186-e1300073931477-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://www.backpackeracker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Picture-186-e1300073931477-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.backpackeracker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Picture-186-e1300073931477.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not exactly Rodeo Drive</p></div>
<p>We headed to bed early that night, unsure of what the hell would we do in the morning.  The first night <em>inside</em> the hostel was shockingly cold.  We weren&#8217;t sure what we expected  Mongolia to be like but 20 degree (F) temps in August wasn&#8217;t what we had  in mind.  We both woke up the next morning somewhat awestruck staring  into our backpacks which had sandals, tank-tops, one pair of pants, and  lots of socks and underwear.  That night and are ill-equipped rucksack  was a lesson in foreshadowing.  Bitter cold was in our future and we  both knew it.</p>

<p>The next morning Papa Mongolia came into the kitchen with  bread and  butter that he offers all his guests.  He tried to pawn us off on some  guided trips to the Gobi or a jeep trip to the ancient capital of  Mongolia but we knew why we had traveled 3 plus days and it wasn&#8217;t to  sit in the back of a jeep and listen to:  &#8220;There is sand, and tree, and  now we meet typical Mongolian family.&#8221;  We told Papa Mongolia of our  plans and I wish I could say he didn&#8217;t immediately look us up and down.   Dave and I both liked to believe we had prepared physically for this  trip but mostly we just played with BB guns and drank beer our last 5  months in South Korea.  We knew if we were ever in a BB gun fight in  Mongolia we&#8217;d crush, but motorcycles in Mongolia?  I think Papa was  right to be sizing us up.</p>
<p>He reluctantly agreed to take us down to the black market (not  stolen things, just what they call it) to search for a motorcycle.  We  grabbed a taxi for a 4 km drive to the other side of town where we  walked the aisles of the old car area looking for acceptable bikes.  My  eyes immediately drifted for the scooters but Dave convinced me a man&#8217;s  bike was needed.  I nodded my head in fear and off we went to the more  &#8220;manly&#8221; bikes.  I&#8217;ll admit it was an awkward few of hours.</p>
<p>Living in South Korea, we had grown accustomed to being stared at,  but as we walked the dirt aisles lined with bikes and spare parts for  horses we noticed we were being sized up as well.  The conversations  weren&#8217;t how you&#8217;d think typical bike-bartering conversations would go  but this was to be expected as both of us had NEVER ridden a motorcycle  before in our lifetimes, a sample if you will</p>
<p>Jared (looking at random bike):  How much for this?<br />
Vendor:  I make good deal, you want to try?<br />
Jared (becoming nervous) Try?  Hmm, so hypothetically speaking, if I were to crash this bike on my &#8220;try&#8221; would I have to buy it?<br />
Vendor: (Staring)<br />
Jared:  Yeah, it looks good to me, I&#8217;ll buy it.</p>
<p>9 days after leaving our comfortable one-bedroom apartments and our  cushy job with air conditioning and heat, we were standing in the black  market of Ulan-Batur, Mongolia with two<br />
motorcycles about to embark on a 2000 km trip.  All the bullshitting had  become a reality, tomorrow we would hit the road.  We were prepared  little for what was to come, but we preferred it that way.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I loved your Mongolian Motorcycle Trip Part 1&#8230; but where is part 2? Did everything work out? Was there a disaster? Did you sell excusive rights to the magazine and so can&#8217;t publish it here?</p>
<p>My wife and I are doing the same thing &#8211; we&#8217;ve just spent 5 months travelling through South East Asia (3 months on purchased 125cc scooters). We&#8217;re on the verge of buying out bikes in Mongolia now. It&#8217;s great to read about other people doing similar things and hearing of their exploits&#8230; and more importantly validating that either (a) we&#8217;re not crazy to be attempting it, or (b) we are crazy but at least we won&#8217;t be alone in the asylum.</p>
<p>I look forward to reading more at some point. </p>
<p>By the way, how did you manage to get a magazine on-board? Did they just randomly find your blog or did you do some legwork?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Nigel</p>
